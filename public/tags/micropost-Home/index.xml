      <description>Today I applied one bottle (29 oz.) of BioAdvancedâ„¢ Concentrate Season Long Weed Killer to my entire lawn in 9 applications using my Ryobi 1-gallon chemical sprayer. Mix was 3.5oz per tank with each application covering about 500 square feet.&#xA;We shall see how it performs. See https://bioadvanced.com/season-long-weed-control-for-lawns.html for more details.&#xA;-/-/-/&#xA;mixture: 704050A&#xA;MenardsSKU: 2634119&#xA;location: Toledo, IA</description>

      <description>Tonight is the night we file our 2022 income taxes. Got nice little refunds from both Federal and Iowa, but all of my Fed refund is going toward first quarter estimated payments for 2023. ðŸ˜•</description>

      <description>My old Hot Spring spa is gone! Listed it at about noon and by 4 PM I had 15 interested parties, most of them very serious. It went to a young couple who came very well prepared to haul it away&amp;hellip; flatbed truck with a lift, and an extra set of muscles. It departed shortly after 8 PM. Well done!&#xA;-/-/-/ location: Toledo, IA</description>

      <description>Mowing the lawn this evening and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to report that most of the weeds I treated last evening have curling leaves. As Young Frankenstein might say&amp;hellip; This could work!</description>

      <description>Finally got to see the doctor today after starting to feel ill on September 3, and to my surprise I tested positive for COVID. Symptoms were mild so I didn&amp;rsquo;t need or receive any treatment.</description>
