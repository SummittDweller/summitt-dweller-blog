      <description>Completed my third soccer officiating assignment tonight&amp;hellip; STC middle school girls and boys doubleheader, plus two B-games, vs. Williamsburg. Another 2.5 hours total play, but again, not too bad. I still have so much to learn!</description>

      <description>My knees and back are definitely feeling better than 2 weeks ago. Tonight I was AR2 for a varsity women&amp;rsquo;s match with Independence at STC. Final score was 11-2 on a very windy night, and it showed. The crew of TJ and Dustin did a great job and I feel like I learned a lot from them tonight. Thank you, gentlemen.</description>

      <description>My back isn&amp;rsquo;t as sore this morning as I expected it might be. I did ref some middle school soccer matches last night on a VERY hard field at STC. Managed to trip over a sprinkler head that I don&amp;rsquo;t think has been &amp;ldquo;used&amp;rdquo; in years.&#xA;-/-/-/&#xA;location: Toledo, IA</description>
