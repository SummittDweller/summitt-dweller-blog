      <description>Driving home from a few days at Univ. of South Dakota in Vermillion last evening and stopped at Justin&amp;rsquo;s house in M-town to meet his parents and grandmother, plus Deb &amp;amp; Doug. We left there about 8:30 or so and I took the old Lincoln Highway into town to avoid deer along the road on the shorter rural route.&#xA;We nearly got hit by an impaired driver (?) when turning on to Center Street just south of the Hy-Vee / Taco John&amp;rsquo;s intersection.</description>

      <description>Do we get extra IHG (Holiday Inn) bonus points for living through the 2 AM false fire alarm last night? NOT FUN. Hope I can drive home this afternoon without falling asleep.&#xA;-/-/-/&#xA;location: Vermillion, SD</description>

      <description>Arrived in Vermillion, South Dakota, last evening about 6:30 PM and went straight to dinner at the &amp;ldquo;Old Lumber Company&amp;rdquo; downtown. Checked in to our hotel adjacent to the Univ. of South Dakota campus at about 7:15 PM and went to find the music department building (the fine arts center) where Christine will be taking classes for the rest of the week.&#xA;While she&amp;rsquo;s in class I&amp;rsquo;ll be working from my hotel room here, or maybe from the USD library.</description>
