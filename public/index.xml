      <description>Summitt Dweller&amp;rsquo;s Blog is an independent publication launched in March 2023 by Mark McFate, aka &amp;ldquo;Summitt Dweller&amp;rdquo;. It replaces an old Hugo site which replaced an old Drupal site many years ago.&#xA;Eleventy (11ty) + Ghost This past weekend my daughter, Mackenzie, made the decision to move her portfolio page into a configuration that features Eleventy (11ty) on the frontend with content managed in Ghost on the backend. I like that combination very much so to help support her move, and learn a little something along the way, we&amp;rsquo;ve setup a new Ghost server in a DigitalOcean droplet, namely ghostonubuntu2204-s-1vcpu-1gb-intel-nyc1-01 , and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make the same move myself.</description>

      <description>During the COVID-19 pandemic I decided, while working endlessly from my home office, to resurect the hanging bird feeder outside my office window. I like having the birds visit, but I‚Äôve noticed one problem‚Ä¶ starlings! They are cranky, bully bastards and chase all the welcome visitors away, if I let them. Well, I don‚Äôt intend to let them anymore. üòÅ I won‚Äôt go into details here but my remedy involves removing the screen from my office window, and occasionally opening the window itself.</description>

      <description>So, the probe Z-offset on my printer seems to be wonky. I noticed during bed leveling that my print head is contacting the bed of my printer just BEFORE the probe is triggered. That&amp;rsquo;s not good! I&amp;rsquo;m going to have a look at BLTouch / CR Touch Z Offset (Z Probe Offset) Calibration in Marlin Firmware to see if I can correct that posthaste.</description>

      <description>A couple of years have now passed since I purchased an Elecrow 5&amp;rsquo; HDMI Touchscreen display for the Raspberry Pi and put it to use. I even 3D printed a very nice case for it. So, there‚Äôs a bit of configuration code on the SD card that can be edited to determine if the 5&amp;rsquo; screen is active, or if the RPI‚Äôs output is directed to its HDMI output port. Well, in the last 2 years I forgot what to edit and what changes to make.</description>

      <description>Not Just a Hugo Issue Take note of the question mark at the end of the title, otherwise it could be somewhat misleading. This is not really a problem with Hugo, but one with cloud deployment of Hugo static apps, particularly as an Azure Static Web App.&#xA;The Nutshell As you may know from post 143, I have successfully installed and configured Pagefind in Rootstalk, but thus far it only works locally.</description>

      <description>Driving home from a few days at Univ. of South Dakota in Vermillion last evening and stopped at Justin&amp;rsquo;s house in M-town to meet his parents and grandmother, plus Deb &amp;amp; Doug. We left there about 8:30 or so and I took the old Lincoln Highway into town to avoid deer along the road on the shorter rural route.&#xA;We nearly got hit by an impaired driver (?) when turning on to Center Street just south of the Hy-Vee / Taco John&amp;rsquo;s intersection.</description>

      <description>Yesterday one of my library colleagues at Grinnell College posted an announcement that Atom would be retired (sunset) in December 2022. Ouch, I have a lot of workflows that depend on Atom!&#xA;So, today part of my mission is to begin the process of migrating workflows, both work-related and personal/at-home, from Atom to its most logical replacement, Visual Studio Code or VS Code as it‚Äôs largely known in the development community.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to give Streamlit a try for some time now. Recently, I found Streamlit DataScience Apps, a GitHub repo full of Streamlit apps, written by Jcharis.

The purpose of the webhook is to rebuild and subsequently deploy the entire blog.&#xA;I thought about using a traditional Ghost action, like site.changed, to do this but I frequently like to post 3 or more blog updates in rapid succession, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want Ghost triggering back-to-back-to-back rebuilds all of the time.</description>

We generally walk in the morning before the heat, humidity, and mosquitoes get too bad. We finally got power back on Thursday evening, August 20, so on Friday morning, August 21, 2020, we walked for the first time since the derecho of August 10.

      <description>Earlier in this blog there&amp;rsquo;s a micropost that lays out the problem at hand. In a nutshell, most of the photos I saved in DigitalOcean Spaces are too big to be effective in this blog. They suck up lots of time and bandwidth every time this blog gets rebuilt, and then they are rendered at a fraction of their original size. This is exceptionall wasteful and unnecessary.&#xA;So, my task this morning is to install, configure, and engage the s3cmd tools to help get this done.</description>

The birthday idea seemed more romantic, but mental health comes first.&#xA;The document was created using a process we recently built and documented in Creating Better Documentation. In this instance of the process we tried to annotate in yellow screen capture elements that need attention, and used red annotation to indicate things that require input or action of some kind.</description>

After a little sleuthing I found that my custom logic to &amp;ldquo;hide all microposts from the home page&amp;rdquo; is working just as one might expect, except that this screws up the number of visible posts per page. Hmmm, this needs some work. Guess I need to legitimately funnel microposts into an entirely separate collection!</description>

      <description>Lately I find that I like to open Markdown documents in MacDown rather than Atom. This is espeically true of things like ‚ÄúREADME.md‚Äù documents that I intend to read, but not edit. This can be done without any special configuration, assuming MacDown is installed and working. To do that use a syntax like this:&#xA;open -b com.uranusjr.macdown path/to/document.md A command I‚Äôve been using quite often today is: open -b com.uranusjr.macdown ~/GitHub/dg-isle/docs/install/install-local-migrate.</description>

It‚Äôs true, I have been thinking about moving that site to make it static, almost certainly using Hugo, but I thought before doing so I‚Äôd give Drupal 8 one more try.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using an iOS app called Publisher for Ghost to craft and post new microposts from my iPhone. Just one problem so far&amp;hellip; I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to successfully edit and save excerpt content so my current scheme of populating the excerpt with &amp;ldquo;front matter&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t working well. So, it&amp;rsquo;s time to move that front matter out of the excerpt and to the end of the content body.&#xA;Update: Publisher for Ghost just isn&amp;rsquo;t cutting it so I did a little research and am on the cusp of making a switch&amp;hellip; to Ulysses, because it has a great little piece of Ghost integration built-in.</description>

      <description>I recently returned from vacation in Norway with a few hundred photos and a handful of videos, taken mostly using my iPhone 8. I find that the Apple Photos app does a pretty nice job of cataloging photos and videos into Moments. Each Moment includes all the images taken in a single day, and sometimes in a particular location, if photos are taken on the same day, but a great distance apart.</description>

What&amp;rsquo;s that, you ask? The common name is Hens and Chicks.&#xA;A couple of weeks ago I bought an on-sale strawberry pot full of Sempervivum tectorum and I have it growing on a little table on the front porch. It&amp;rsquo;s doing QUITE WELL there! A couple of days ago I uprooted a 3 foot square patch of Snow on the Mountain from a spot in my front flower beds (outside out southeast bedroom window), and that left a big bare patch of soil to be dealt with.</description>

      <description>Ok, I get the sense that constantly pulling enormous digital images from DigitalOcean Spaces to rebuild this blog is unnecessarily chewing up lots of bandwidth. Today I&amp;rsquo;d like to begin fixing that by creating a utility, probably in Python, to grab all those images one-by-one, make a smaller copy of each, and put those copies back into a web-ready subdirectory in Spaces, or something like that.&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s a wealth of probably pertinent information to be had in https://docs.</description>

I made a note to come back and look closer at Pagefind, and my new blog &amp;ndash; this blog that you&amp;rsquo;re presumably reading right now &amp;ndash; really needed a search feature, so the &amp;ldquo;Search&amp;rdquo; box on this page (I hope it&amp;rsquo;s there) is the outcome.&#xA;Glad I Found Pagefind So, I started looking closely at search options and considered things like Lunr, which I&amp;rsquo;ve used before, and Solr, which I both love and hate (because of its JAVA roots).</description>

      <description>Just thought I would post a couple more photos, with a probable update later today. Took these photos yesterday (Friday, January 12) at about noon when I ventured outside to clear the driveway. Didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get it all done because it was just too cold and windy, and the snow was still falling. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even attempt to clear the front porch&amp;hellip; ain&amp;rsquo;t nobody coming to visit today anyway. 8^) There are steps and a deck under there somewhere.</description>

      <description>Maybe not as bad as predicted (at least per some predictions) but it was enough wet snow for me. Took almost an hour to clear using my EGO cordless snow-thrower (love it) and there&amp;rsquo;s more to be done before Mackenzie and I can leave for work in the morning. Fortunately both Grinnell College and South Tama County schools were closed today. GC re-opens at noon tomorrow and STC just announced that they will be closed on Wednesday too.</description>

Two members of our immediate family, Sully and Stitch, passed away on November 14th and 20th, respectively. Sully was our male kitty, only about 6 years old and his passing was a real shock. He was an ornery, sometimes grumpy cat, but very loveable at times. We miss him very much. Stitch was the matriarch of our cat family, about 18 years old and a gorgeous long-haired kitty.</description>

      <description>So, node and npm seem to be all the rage these days, and perhaps for good reason. I recently fell in love with Eleventy/11ty over Hugo because it&amp;rsquo;s Javascript, not Go, and it&amp;rsquo;s elegantly simple with tons of flexibility. I recently tried to add Pagefind search to a Hugo static web site (see https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/143-significant-rootstalk-retooling/).

      <description>I ran into a big road block with implementation of Pagefind in Rootstalk today&amp;hellip; everything works fine in development, but I can&amp;rsquo;t easily deploy to Azure because there&amp;rsquo;s no way to &amp;ldquo;inject&amp;rdquo; Pagefind into an Azure Static Web App build before the &amp;ldquo;public&amp;rdquo; content gets deployed. I can generate the Pagefind parts after deployment, but that does me no good.&#xA;Tomorrow I need to have a look at my Rootstalk DigitalOcean deployment to see if what I already have might work there (DO uses a build script that I can add an npx.</description>
