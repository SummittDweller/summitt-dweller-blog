For now I'm doing that \\\"manually\\\" by opening a new post and copying content from old .md files into them one-at-a-time.  Using that tedious process I managed to copy 8 posts forward into this blog.\\n\\nAlong the way I also did some quick investigation of [post2ghost](https://github.com/dumrauf/post2ghost), a utility aimed at helping populate Ghost posts from .md files.  Great idea!  Unfortunately, it looks like that work relies on an ancient version of the Ghost API, and I don't think it will work at all with the latest due to extensive changes in the API.\\n\\nStill, I very much like the idea behind `post2ghost` and I also like the name.  Maybe I'll reach out and see if I can borrow the name and leverage the new Ghost API along with my [Hugo Front Matter Tools](https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/hugo-front-matter-tools) project to create a Python script that will read .md files with front matter and turn them into API-compatible JSON for bulk creation of new Ghost posts.  More on that effort later...\\n\\n## Next Step - Deploy and Assign an Address\\nCurrently this new blog is only available locally as https://localhost:8080 because it does not yet deploy to any internet host.  The [Eleventy Starter Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/eleventy-starter-ghost) project that I'm following is equiped to deploy a site to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and use deploy hooks from Ghost to trigger Netlify rebuilds. \\n\\nNetlify is fine, but I only use them as a last resort, and thus far that's only for the [Wieting Theatre](https://Wieting.TamaToledo.com) where I rely on NetlifyCMS to manage backend content.  Ironically, NetlifyCMS was just rebranded as `Decap CMS`.  See https://www.netlify.com/blog/netlify-cms-to-become-decap-cms/ for details.\\n\\nSo, I'm going to try and reproduce the triggers, hooks and actions intended for Netlify with my own GitHub Action (plus whatever it takes) to deploy this blog as https://blog.SummittDweller.com.  That URL currently delivers a Hugo static site hosted on DigitalOcean (DO).  Since my Ghost instance is also on DO I think I'll take a crack at deploying this blog to DO App Platform as a Starter App.  I hope that the guidance provided in [Step 11 — Deploying to DigitalOcean with App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-and-deploy-your-first-eleventy-website#step-11-deploying-to-digitalocean-with-app-platform) proves helpful.\\n\\n### Step 11 — Deploying to DigitalOcean with App Platform - My Specifics\\n\\nThe aforementioned guidance did indeed prove helpful, although it is a little out-dated compared to my acutal experience, which is detailed below in up-to-date (as of March 2023) words and pictures, of course.\\n\\nFirst I visited my DigitalOcean account and clicked the `Create` button as directed.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 0001.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/0001.png\\\" />\\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\"> \\n    Figure 1. Replacing the `blogs-summitt-dweller` app in DigitalOcean. Click `Create`.\\n  </figcaption>\\n</figure>    \\n\\nNext, I selected `Apps` as directed in order to initiate the creation of a new `App`. \\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 0011.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/0011.png\\\" />\\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 2. Select 'Apps'.<figcaption>\\n</figure>    \\n\\nThis app is to be built from a GitHub repo so I chose `GitHub`, allowed the system to lookup all the GitHub repositories I've given DigitalOcean permisison to \\\"see\\\". \\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 0027.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/0027.png\\\" /> \\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 3. Select `GitHub` and then the new site project repo.<figcaption>\\n</figure>    \\n\\nI choose the my `SummittDweller/blog-eleventy-ghost` repo. \\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 0045.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/0045.png\\\" /> \\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 4. Choose the repo.<figcaption>\\n</figure>  \\n\\nThen accepted all the defaults for the `main` branch, the `/` root directory (of the project repo), the default for `Auto Deploy`, and clicked `Next` to proceed. \\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 0065.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/0065.png\\\" /> \\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 5. Accept defaults and click `Next`.<figcaption>\\n</figure>    \\n\\nUnfortunately, when I initiated the process DigitalOcean detected the repo as a \\\"Web Service\\\", perhaps because of the `netlify.toml` file?  I don't want to create a \\\"Web Service\\\" since those are more complex and expensive than a simple static 11ty site.  So, I choose to edit the `Resource Type` to change that.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 0861.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/0861.png\\\" /> \\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 6. Edit the `Resource Type`...<figcaption>\\n</figure>    \\n\\nI subsequently choose a `Static Site` and clicked to `Save` the change.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 0916.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/0916.png\\\" /> \\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 7. Choose `Static Site` and click `Save`.<figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nMy 11ty project generates static content into the project's `/dist` directory so I edited the `Output Directory` setting, set it to `dist` and clicked to `Save` that change.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 0954.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/0954.png\\\" /> \\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 8. Edit the `Output Directory`...<figcaption>\\n</figure>    \\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 0970.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/0970.png\\\" /> \\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 9. Set to `dist` and click `Save`.<figcaption>\\n</figure>    \\n\\nNext I clicked `Back` to find the \\\"Billing\\\" section, review the new deployment fees (should be $3/month or less), and click `Create Resources` to begin the first build and deployment.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 1003.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/1003.png\\\" /> \\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 10. Click `Back`...<figcaption>\\n</figure>    \\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 1114.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/1114.png\\\" /> \\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 11. Review fees and click `Create Resources`.<figcaption>\\n</figure>    \\n\\nIt took a few minutes, but once the app is complete you should see a screen like that shown in Figure 12 below.  Another unfortunate stumble... I forgot to change my App name up front so it carries a meaningless, random name of `coral-app`.  Let's change that now.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 1139.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/1139.png\\\" /> \\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 12. App was created, but with a meaningless  name.<figcaption>\\n</figure>    \\n\\nI clicked `Edit` in the \\\"App Settings / Info\\\" section and changed the name to better represent the project and site that's been created.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 1258.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/1258.png\\\" /> \\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 13.

Specify a better name and click `Save`.<figcaption>\\n</figure>    \\n\\nNote that the unique URL generated for the app did NOT change.  I fear we are stuck with that name, but it won't be a concern for very long.  Once the deployment is done you should see a `Live App` link/button.  Click it!\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 1494.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/1494.png\\\" /> \\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 15. Wait for the app to deploy and click `Live App`.<figcaption>\\n</figure>    \\n\\nEureka!  We should have a new site deployed to DigitalOcean.\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 1513.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/1513.png\\\" /> \\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 16. Eureka, we have an app!<figcaption>\\n</figure>    \\n\\nOne more thing to do, give this new site a meaningful URL.  Open the `Manage` screen and our new app, the click the `Settings` tab. \\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 2014.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/2014.png\\\" /> \\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 17. Manage the app and click `Settings`.<figcaption>\\n</figure> \\n\\nClick `Add Domain` and enter the \\\"correct\\\" URL.  In this case the app needs to respond at https://blog.SummittDweller.com.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 2024.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/2024.png\\\" /> \\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 18. Click `Add Domain`.<figcaption>\\n</figure>    \\n\\nMy registar already points the `summittdweller.com` domain at the DigitalOcean DNS servers, so I choose `DigitalOcean DNS` as the keeper of the domain's records.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 2062.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/2062.png\\\" /> \\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 19. Enter the new domain name and choose DigitalOcean DNS.<figcaption>\\n</figure>    \\n\\nAfter the domain is added I needed great patience since I could visit the site, but no valid certificates had been generated yet.  I was able to check my DigitalOcean `Network` screen to see that a new CNAME record has been added for the site, and after about 30 minutes I was finally able to open the \\\"secure\\\" site at https://blog.SummittDweller.com.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 2165.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/2165.png\\\" /> \\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 20.

Visit `Networking` and observe a new CNAME record.<figcaption>\\n</figure>    \\n\\n## Customization: Formatting Figures and Matomo\\n\\nOk, now that the domain is added I wanted to introduce my first bonafide customizations, namely \\n\\n  - Better formatting of figures like you see in the previous section and below, and  \\n  - Introduction of my [Matomo](https://analytics.summittservices.com) tracking code.\\n\\n### Using Code Injection\\n\\nGhost has a nice feature called `Code Injection` that allows me to inject snippets of Javascript and CSS into every page's header and footer.  Not sure I'm \\\"sold\\\" on the use of `Code Injection` since it puts \\\"code\\\" into a database, and that's something I don't care to do.  However, as a short-term \\\"test\\\" it's a wonderful feature.\\n\\nTo engage it I visited my blog's [Ghost admin page](__GHOST_URL__/ghost) and clicked on the `gear icon` (lower-left red box in Figure 22 below) then selected the `Code Injection` as shown below.  The code injection screen that opens provides both header and footer editing spaces where Javascript and/or CSS can be added. \\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Ghost-Code-Injection-01.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/Ghost-Code-Injection-01.png\\\" />\\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 22. Opening Ghost Code Injection.</figcaption>\\n</figure>  \\n\\nThe CSS that I added in the header was:\\n\\n```js\\n<style>\\n  p > figure > figcaption {\\n    font-weight: 400;\\n    font-style: italic;\\n    font-size: 16px;\\n    color: black;\\n    outline: 0;\\n    z-index: 300;\\n    padding: 2px 5px;\\n    text-align: left;\\n  }\\n    \\n  p > figure > img {\\n    border: 1px solid black;\\n  }    \\n</style>  \\n```\\n\\nThe Javascript code injected into the footer was:\\n\\n```js\\n<script>\\n  // Creates Captions from img Title attributes\\n  $(\\\"img\\\").each(\\n    function() {\\n      // Let's make the title a caption\\n      if ($(this).attr(\\\"title\\\")) {\\n        $(this).wrap(\\n          '<figure class=\\\"figure\\\"></figure>'\\n        ).after(\\n          '<figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">' +\\n             $(this).attr(\\\"title\\\") +\\n          '</figcaption>'\\n      );\\n    }\\n  });\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\nBoth of the above code snippets were inspired by blogger [Kevin Chung](https://blog.kchung.co/author/kchung/) and his [Adding image captions to Ghost](https://blog.kchung.co/adding-image-captions-to-ghost/) post.  Kevin's code looked for any `![alt](src)` image references in the content and reformatted them into HTML that looked something like this:\\n\\n```html\\n<figure class=\\\"figure\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/0011.png\\\" alt=\\\"Image file is 0011.png\\\" title=\\\"Figure 2. Select 'Apps'.\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\"/>\\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\">Figure 2. Select 'Apps'.</figcaption>\\n</figure>    \\n```\\n\\nKevin's original code modified ALL of the images, the `<img>` tags, in the post if they had `alt` attributes, and in my case that's ALL images.  That's not what I wanted to happen, so I reworked the logic so that only images (`<img>`) with `title` attributes would get captured and reformatted.  That worked nicely, but my results were inconsistent.  The behavior I saw in localhost rendering was different than in my Ghost site, and sometimes differnt than in my Elevent site.  Not good.\\n\\nAll of the Markdown for the figures, like those in this section and above, that I wanted to control is generated using my [Convert Videos to Frames](https://github.com/SummittDweller/convert_videos_to_frames) utility, I chose to take the bull by the horns and just have it generate exactly the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` HTML that I wanted to see.  So, the raw Markdown for the figure you see above is simply:\\n\\n```html\\n<figure>\\n  <img class=\\\"figure\\\" alt=\\\"Ghost-Code-Injection-01.png\\\" src=\\\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/Ghost-Code-Injection-01.png\\\" />\\n  <figcaption class=\\\"figure\\\"> \\n    Figure 22. Opening Ghost Code Injection.\\n  </figcaption>\\n</figure> \\n```\\n\\nThe images in this instance are housed as BLOBs in _Azure Storage_ and served directly from there. \\n\\nThe simple/raw approach that I ultimately arrived at is consistent and to-the-point, and it doesn't need any Ghost code injection so I removed all of the \\\"injected\\\" code from __GHOST_URL__/ghost/#/settings/code-injection.  I also found that I could achieve better, more consistent CSS control by adding custom code to the end of the project's `src/_includes/css/styles.css` file like so:\\n      \\n```css\\n/* Summitt Dweller styles\\n/* ---------------------------------------------------------- */\\n\\nfigure img.figure.lazyloaded {\\n  border: 1px solid black;\\n}\\n\\nfigure {\\n  text-align: center;\\n}\\n\\n.post-full-content figcaption {\\n  margin: 0.2em 3em 0;\\n  font-size: 55%;\\n  line-height: 1.6em;\\n  text-align: center;\\n  font-weight: 400;\\n}\\n\\ncode {\\n  font-family: monospace,monospace;\\n  font-size: .75em;\\n  background: #eceebd;\\n  padding: 2px 5px;\\n  border-radius: 5px;\\n}\\n\\npre > code {\\n  background: none;\\n  padding: 0;\\n}\\n```      \\n\\nThe intent is to wrap the images with a `class=\\\"figure\\\"` attribute in a nice little black border, and more! \\n      \\n      \\n### Matomo\\n\\nWhile Ghost code injection didn't behave well for reformatting figures, it does work nicely, and consistently, for Matomo tracking!  However, I'd still prefer to put as much as possible into code, not into a database, so I grabbed a copy of my Matomo code that's specifically for [this blog](https://blog.SummittDweller.com) and applied it like so in the project's `src/_includes/layouts/default.njk` file: \\n\\n```js\\n<!-- Matomo -->\\n<script>\\n  var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];\\n  /* tracker methods like \\\"setCustomDimension\\\" should be called before \\\"trackPageView\\\" */\\n  _paq.push(['trackPageView']);\\n  _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);\\n  (function() {\\n    var u=\\\"https://analytics.summittservices.com/\\\";\\n    _paq.push(['setTrackerUrl', u+'matomo.php']);\\n    _paq.push(['setSiteId', '10']);\\n    var d=document, g=d.createElement('script'), s=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\\n    g.async=true; g.src=u+'matomo.js'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);\\n  })();\\n</script>\\n<!-- End Matomo Code -->\\n```\\n\\nBeautimous. It just works!\\n\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"code\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://github.com/TryGhost/eleventy-starter-ghost\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://hooshmand.net/host-a-second-or-multiple-ghost-blogs-on-one-server/\"]],[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://gist.github.com/SummittDweller/1af7ecbb9051ee04d0a9dbad7f74c1e7\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://eleventy.ghost.io/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"__GHOST_URL__/ghost/#/settings/integrations/64185c1723ad590d103c051a\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"This past weekend my daughter, Mackenzie, made the decision to move her portfolio page into a configuration that features Eleventy (11ty) on the frontend with content managed in Ghost on the backend.

The <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/eleventy-starter-ghost\">Eleventy Starter Ghost</a> project that I'm following is equiped to deploy a site to <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com\">Netlify</a> and use deploy hooks from Ghost to trigger Netlify rebuilds.</p>\n<p>Netlify is fine, but I only use them as a last resort, and thus far that's only for the <a href=\"https://Wieting.TamaToledo.com\">Wieting Theatre</a> where I rely on NetlifyCMS to manage backend content.  Ironically, NetlifyCMS was just rebranded as <code>Decap CMS</code>.  See <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/netlify-cms-to-become-decap-cms/\">https://www.netlify.com/blog/netlify-cms-to-become-decap-cms/</a> for details.</p>\n<p>So, I'm going to try and reproduce the triggers, hooks and actions intended for Netlify with my own GitHub Action (plus whatever it takes) to deploy this blog as <a href=\"https://blog.SummittDweller.com\">https://blog.SummittDweller.com</a>.  That URL currently delivers a Hugo static site hosted on DigitalOcean (DO).  Since my Ghost instance is also on DO I think I'll take a crack at deploying this blog to DO App Platform as a Starter App.  I hope that the guidance provided in <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-and-deploy-your-first-eleventy-website#step-11-deploying-to-digitalocean-with-app-platform\">Step 11 — Deploying to DigitalOcean with App Platform</a> proves helpful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"step-11-%E2%80%94-deploying-to-digitalocean-with-app-platformmy-specifics\">Step 11 — Deploying to DigitalOcean with App Platform - My Specifics</h3>\n<p>The aforementioned guidance did indeed prove helpful, although it is a little out-dated compared to my acutal experience, which is detailed below in up-to-date (as of March 2023) words and pictures, of course.</p>\n<p>First I visited my DigitalOcean account and clicked the <code>Create</code> button as directed.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img class=\"figure\" alt=\"Image file is 0001.png\" src=\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/0001.png\" />\n  <figcaption class=\"figure\"> \n    Figure 1.

However, as a short-term &quot;test&quot; it's a wonderful feature.</p>\n<p>To engage it I visited my blog's <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/ghost\">Ghost admin page</a> and clicked on the <code>gear icon</code> (lower-left red box in Figure 22 below) then selected the <code>Code Injection</code> as shown below.

That's not what I wanted to happen, so I reworked the logic so that only images (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>) with <code>title</code> attributes would get captured and reformatted.  That worked nicely, but my results were inconsistent.  The behavior I saw in localhost rendering was different than in my Ghost site, and sometimes differnt than in my Elevent site.  Not good.</p>\n<p>All of the Markdown for the figures, like those in this section and above, that I wanted to control is generated using my <a href=\"https://github.com/SummittDweller/convert_videos_to_frames\">Convert Videos to Frames</a> utility, I chose to take the bull by the horns and just have it generate exactly the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> HTML that I wanted to see.

            "plaintext": "This past weekend my daughter, Mackenzie, made the decision to move her portfolio page into a configuration that features Eleventy (11ty) on the frontend with content managed in Ghost on the backend.  I like that combination very much so to help support her move, and learn a little something along the way, we've setup a new Ghost server in a DigitalOcean droplet, namely ghostonubuntu2204-s-1vcpu-1gb-intel-nyc1-01 , and I've decided to make the same move myself.  \n\nThis post is intended to track my blog's journey from a git workflow (for both structure and content) in Hugo, to Eleventy + Ghost, and it begins with the guidance provided in https://github.com/TryGhost/eleventy-starter-ghost.  I already have a working Ghost server as mentioned above, the one that we setup for Mackenzie's portfolio, and we've already followed Install and host Multiple Ghost blog Servers on One Server to create the Ghost backend for this blog on the same DO droplet that host's Mackenzie's portfolio content.  The admin interface for my blog instance of Ghost is shown below.  \n\nGhost AdminGhost\n\n\nCreating the 11ty Frontend\n\nWorking locally on my Mac Mini this is the input I captured...\n\ncd ~/GitHub\ngit clone https://github.com/TryGhost/eleventy-starter-ghost.git blog-eleventy-ghost\ncd blog-eleventy-ghost\nyarn\nyarn start\n^C\n\nNote that complete input and output from all commands is available in https://gist.github.com/SummittDweller/1af7ecbb9051ee04d0a9dbad7f74c1e7.\n\nThat worked flawlessly and it's quick too!  \n\n\nSaving This Work in GitHub\n\nTime to save what's been done here before our progress is lost, and I didn't fork the TryGhost/eleventy-starter-ghost project because I don't intend to try and improve it, so my project needs a new GitHub home.  My typical process for doing that looks something like this...\n\nrm -fr .git\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"First commit\"\ngit branch -M main\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/SummittDweller/blog-eleventy-ghost.git\ngit push -u origin main\n\n\nReplacing the Ghost Backend\n\nBy default the project I'm using connects its 11ty frontend to a Ghost backend at https://eleventy.ghost.io/.  Fortunately, my project's README.md file, an ammended copy from the original TryGhost project, also provides the simple guidance required to change that, like so...\n\nFirst, I visited https://blog-ghost.summittservices.com/ghost/#/settings/integrations/ to create new API keys, and saved them in my password vault.  Next, I needed to edit the project's .env file to read like this:\n\n# GHOST_API_URL=https://eleventy.ghost.io\n# GHOST_CONTENT_API_KEY=5a562eebab8528c44e856a3e0a\nGHOST_API_URL=https://blog-ghost.summittservices.com\nGHOST_CONTENT_API_KEY=***********hidden****************\nSITE_URL=http://localhost:8080\n\nDone.  When the blog-ghost.summittservices.com instance of Ghost was created I took steps to \"make it private\", so it should function as a backend only.   So, running yarn start with the new .env configuration should give me a stripped-down localhost:8080 edition of the blog pulling content from the intended Ghost backend, like so:\n\nyarn start\n\n\nYup, that works!  I get something that looks like this now:\n\nEven better, when I save and Publish my work on this post, effectively removing its \"Draft\" status in blog-ghost.summittservices.com, I should see an instantaneous update in my https://localhost:8080 instance of the blog.  Wish me luck...  \n\nBeautimous!  Well, almost.  The change to the site was not \"instantaneous\", but after a quick ctrl-c and a new yarn start we have this:\n\n\nMigrating Content\n\n\nNow that we have a working local site, it's time to copy some content (posts and microposts) that I wish to keep from my old blog at https://github.com/SummittDweller/blogs-SummittDweller into blog-ghost.summittservices.com. For now I'm doing that \"manually\" by opening a new post and copying content from old .md files into them one-at-a-time. Using that tedious process I managed to copy 8 posts forward into this blog.\n\n\nAlong the way I also did some quick investigation of post2ghost, a utility aimed at helping populate Ghost posts from .md files. Great idea! Unfortunately, it looks like that work relies on an ancient version of the Ghost API, and I don't think it will work at all with the latest due to extensive changes in the API.\n\n\nStill, I very much like the idea behind post2ghost and I also like the name. Maybe I'll reach out and see if I can borrow the name and leverage the new Ghost API along with my Hugo Front Matter Tools project to create a Python script that will read .md files with front matter and turn them into API-compatible JSON for bulk creation of new Ghost posts. More on that effort later...\n\n\n\nNext Step - Deploy and Assign an Address\n\n\nCurrently this new blog is only available locally as https://localhost:8080 because it does not yet deploy to any internet host. The Eleventy Starter Ghost project that I'm following is equiped to deploy a site to Netlify and use deploy hooks from Ghost to trigger Netlify rebuilds.\n\n\nNetlify is fine, but I only use them as a last resort, and thus far that's only for the Wieting Theatre where I rely on NetlifyCMS to manage backend content. Ironically, NetlifyCMS was just rebranded as Decap CMS. See https://www.netlify.com/blog/netlify-cms-to-become-decap-cms/ for details.\n\n\nSo, I'm going to try and reproduce the triggers, hooks and actions intended for Netlify with my own GitHub Action (plus whatever it takes) to deploy this blog as https://blog.SummittDweller.com. That URL currently delivers a Hugo static site hosted on DigitalOcean (DO). Since my Ghost instance is also on DO I think I'll take a crack at deploying this blog to DO App Platform as a Starter App. I hope that the guidance provided in Step 11 — Deploying to DigitalOcean with App Platform proves helpful.\n\n\n\nStep 11 — Deploying to DigitalOcean with App Platform - My Specifics\n\n\nThe aforementioned guidance did indeed prove helpful, although it is a little out-dated compared to my acutal experience, which is detailed below in up-to-date (as of March 2023) words and pictures, of course.\n\n\nFirst I visited my DigitalOcean account and clicked the Create button as directed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, I selected Apps as directed in order to initiate the creation of a new App.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis app is to be built from a GitHub repo so I chose GitHub, allowed the system to lookup all the GitHub repositories I've given DigitalOcean permisison to \"see\".\n\n\n\n\n\nI choose the my SummittDweller/blog-eleventy-ghost repo.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen accepted all the defaults for the main branch, the / root directory (of the project repo), the default for Auto Deploy, and clicked Next to proceed.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, when I initiated the process DigitalOcean detected the repo as a \"Web Service\", perhaps because of the netlify.toml file? I don't want to create a \"Web Service\" since those are more complex and expensive than a simple static 11ty site. So, I choose to edit the Resource Type to change that.\n\n\n\n\n\nI subsequently choose a Static Site and clicked to Save the change.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy 11ty project generates static content into the project's /dist directory so I edited the Output Directory setting, set it to dist and clicked to Save that change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext I clicked Back to find the \"Billing\" section, review the new deployment fees (should be $3/month or less), and click Create Resources to begin the first build and deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took a few minutes, but once the app is complete you should see a screen like that shown in Figure 12 below. Another unfortunate stumble... I forgot to change my App name up front so it carries a meaningless, random name of coral-app. Let's change that now.\n\n\n\n\n\nI clicked Edit in the \"App Settings / Info\" section and changed the name to better represent the project and site that's been created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the unique URL generated for the app did NOT change. I fear we are stuck with that name, but it won't be a concern for very long. Once the deployment is done you should see a Live App link/button. Click it!\n\n\n\n\n\nEureka! We should have a new site deployed to DigitalOcean.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne more thing to do, give this new site a meaningful URL. Open the Manage screen and our new app, the click the Settings tab.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Add Domain and enter the \"correct\" URL. In this case the app needs to respond at https://blog.SummittDweller.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy registar already points the summittdweller.com domain at the DigitalOcean DNS servers, so I choose DigitalOcean DNS as the keeper of the domain's records.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the domain is added I needed great patience since I could visit the site, but no valid certificates had been generated yet. I was able to check my DigitalOcean Network screen to see that a new CNAME record has been added for the site, and after about 30 minutes I was finally able to open the \"secure\" site at https://blog.SummittDweller.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomization: Formatting Figures and Matomo\n\n\nOk, now that the domain is added I wanted to introduce my first bonafide customizations, namely\n\n\n * Better formatting of figures like you see in the previous section and below, and\n * Introduction of my Matomo tracking code.\n\n\n\nUsing Code Injection\n\n\nGhost has a nice feature called Code Injection that allows me to inject snippets of Javascript and CSS into every page's header and footer. Not sure I'm \"sold\" on the use of Code Injection since it puts \"code\" into a database, and that's something I don't care to do. However, as a short-term \"test\" it's a wonderful feature.\n\n\nTo engage it I visited my blog's Ghost admin page and clicked on the gear icon (lower-left red box in Figure 22 below) then selected the Code Injection as shown below. The code injection screen that opens provides both header and footer editing spaces where Javascript and/or CSS can be added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CSS that I added in the header was:\n\n\n<style>\n  p > figure > figcaption {\n    font-weight: 400;\n    font-style: italic;\n    font-size: 16px;\n    color: black;\n    outline: 0;\n    z-index: 300;\n    padding: 2px 5px;\n    text-align: left;\n  }\n    \n  p > figure > img {\n    border: 1px solid black;\n  }    \n</style>  \n\n\n\nThe Javascript code injected into the footer was:\n\n\n<script>\n  // Creates Captions from img Title attributes\n  $(\"img\").each(\n    function() {\n      // Let's make the title a caption\n      if ($(this).attr(\"title\")) {\n        $(this).wrap(\n          '<figure class=\"figure\"></figure>'\n        ).after(\n          '<figcaption class=\"figure\">' +\n             $(this).attr(\"title\") +\n          '</figcaption>'\n      );\n    }\n  });\n</script>\n\n\n\nBoth of the above code snippets were inspired by blogger Kevin Chung and his Adding image captions to Ghost post. Kevin's code looked for any ![alt](src) image references in the content and reformatted them into HTML that looked something like this:\n\n\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n  <img src=\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/0011.png\" alt=\"Image file is 0011.png\" title=\"Figure 2. Select 'Apps'.\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n  <figcaption class=\"figure\">Figure 2. Select 'Apps'.</figcaption>\n</figure>    \n\n\n\nKevin's original code modified ALL of the images, the <img> tags, in the post if they had alt attributes, and in my case that's ALL images. That's not what I wanted to happen, so I reworked the logic so that only images (<img>) with title attributes would get captured and reformatted. That worked nicely, but my results were inconsistent. The behavior I saw in localhost rendering was different than in my Ghost site, and sometimes differnt than in my Elevent site. Not good.\n\n\nAll of the Markdown for the figures, like those in this section and above, that I wanted to control is generated using my Convert Videos to Frames utility, I chose to take the bull by the horns and just have it generate exactly the <figure> and <figcaption> HTML that I wanted to see. So, the raw Markdown for the figure you see above is simply:\n\n\n<figure>\n  <img class=\"figure\" alt=\"Ghost-Code-Injection-01.png\" src=\"https://sddocs.blob.core.windows.net/documentation/Eleventy-Ghost/Ghost-Code-Injection-01.png\" />\n  <figcaption class=\"figure\"> \n    Figure 22. Opening Ghost Code Injection.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure> \n\n\n\nThe images in this instance are housed as BLOBs in Azure Storage and served directly from there.\n\n\nThe simple/raw approach that I ultimately arrived at is consistent and to-the-point, and it doesn't need any Ghost code injection so I removed all of the \"injected\" code from https://blog-ghost.summittservices.com/ghost/#/settings/code-injection. I also found that I could achieve better, more consistent CSS control by adding custom code to the end of the project's src/_includes/css/styles.css file like so:\n\n\n/* Summitt Dweller styles\n/* ---------------------------------------------------------- */\n\nfigure img.figure.lazyloaded {\n  border: 1px solid black;\n}\n\nfigure {\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\n.post-full-content figcaption {\n  margin: 0.2em 3em 0;\n  font-size: 55%;\n  line-height: 1.6em;\n  text-align: center;\n  font-weight: 400;\n}\n\ncode {\n  font-family: monospace,monospace;\n  font-size: .75em;\n  background: #eceebd;\n  padding: 2px 5px;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n}\n\npre > code {\n  background: none;\n  padding: 0;\n}\n\n\n\nThe intent is to wrap the images with a class=\"figure\" attribute in a nice little black border, and more!\n\n\n\nMatomo\n\n\nWhile Ghost code injection didn't behave well for reformatting figures, it does work nicely, and consistently, for Matomo tracking!

That's not a huge problem, but I've never come close to using even one-half of my data in any previous month.  I suspect this is due to all the massive image downloads taking place each time I build a dev copy of this blog.\\n\\nThe `yarn start` command that I use to build the `localhost` copy of this blog defines `ELEVENTY_ENV=dev`.  I'm going to see if I can use this environment setting to limit image downloads to the first ten in order to limit the \\\"dev\\\" download requirements.  If this works a switch of some kind might need to be defined so that I can override the limit as needed. \\n\\n☑️ __Solved 20-Apr-2023__: This played out nicely, but rather than limited the number of images I simply limit the number of `posts` pulled by `.eleventy.js`.  The code looks like this now:\\n\\n```js\\n var environ = process.env.ELEVENTY_ENV;\\n console.log(\\\"ELEVENTY_ENV is: \\\", environ);\\n if (environ == \\\"dev\\\") {\\n   post_limit = 6;\\n } else {\\n   post_limit = 'all';\\n }\\n\\n collection = await api.posts\\n   .browse({\\n     filter: \\\"tag:-micropost\\\",\\n     include: \\\"tags,authors\\\",\\n     limit: post_limit\\n   })\\n...\\n```\\n\\n<hr/> \"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"\\n#### Implement robust site search.\\nJust like it says ^^^ there.

Specifically, I'm going to move the \\\"front matter\\\" for all content types out of the `excerpt`, because it's difficult/impossible to edit excerpts in my iPhone's _Ghost Publisher_ software, and put it at the bottom of the content body with a `---` seperator marking the start of the data.  It should look something like this example:\\n\\n```\\n---\\nlocation: Toledo, IA\\nprice: $50.00\\nnote: This is just a note.\\n```\\n\\nBasically, anything found at the bottom of a post, of any TYPE, below a `---` delimiter, becomes a key:value pair available in `post.data.<key>`. \\n\\n☑️ __Solved 5-Apr-2023__: This is done but not as originally planned, and it may still need some work.  So, in the end I introduced a new `for_sale` tag (note that like `micropost` it's all lowercase to set it apart from others) after trying to use other techniques.  \\n\\nMy new \\\"rear matter\\\" solution, detailed in the project's `README.md` file, actually uses a `dash-slash-dash` delimiter at the bottom of the content body, immediately followed by a `slash-dash-slash` delimiter... all run together in 6 characters, no spaces.\\n\\nThe first delimiter marks the end of the content, while the second one marks the start of the \\\"rear matter\\\".

That's not a huge problem, but I've never come close to using even one-half of my data in any previous month.  I suspect this is due to all the massive image downloads taking place each time I build a dev copy of this blog.</p>\n<p>The <code>yarn start</code> command that I use to build the <code>localhost</code> copy of this blog defines <code>ELEVENTY_ENV=dev</code>.  I'm going to see if I can use this environment setting to limit image downloads to the first ten in order to limit the &quot;dev&quot; download requirements.  If this works a switch of some kind might need to be defined so that I can override the limit as needed.</p>\n<p>☑️ <strong>Solved 20-Apr-2023</strong>: This played out nicely, but rather than limited the number of images I simply limit the number of <code>posts</code> pulled by <code>.eleventy.js</code>.

Specifically, I'm going to move the &quot;front matter&quot; for all content types out of the <code>excerpt</code>, because it's difficult/impossible to edit excerpts in my iPhone's <em>Ghost Publisher</em> software, and put it at the bottom of the content body with a <code>---</code> seperator marking the start of the data.  It should look something like this example:</p>\n<pre><code>---\nlocation: Toledo, IA\nprice: $50.00\nnote: This is just a note.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Basically, anything found at the bottom of a post, of any TYPE, below a <code>---</code> delimiter, becomes a key:value pair available in <code>post.data.&lt;key&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>☑️ <strong>Solved 5-Apr-2023</strong>: This is done but not as originally planned, and it may still need some work.

Another feature that my old Hugo blog supported, although I rarely kept it up-to-date.\n\n\n\n\nImplement my Hugo Timeline module.\n\n\nMake an 11ty version of https://github.com/SummittDweller/hugo-timeline and implement it here.\n\n\n\n\nEngage Disqus Comments.\n\n\nAnother feature that my old Hugo blog had, and my professional blog still uses. Rinse and repeat.\n\n\n\nEverything below this line is DONE!  For now.\n\nPulling Too Much Data\n\n\nToday (April 20, 2023) I received notice from Mediacom, my ISP, that I've used 75% of my monthly data allotment with about a week left in the term. That's not a huge problem, but I've never come close to using even one-half of my data in any previous month. I suspect this is due to all the massive image downloads taking place each time I build a dev copy of this blog.\n\n\nThe yarn start command that I use to build the localhost copy of this blog defines ELEVENTY_ENV=dev. I'm going to see if I can use this environment setting to limit image downloads to the first ten in order to limit the \"dev\" download requirements. If this works a switch of some kind might need to be defined so that I can override the limit as needed.\n\n\n☑️ Solved 20-Apr-2023: This played out nicely, but rather than limited the number of images I simply limit the number of posts pulled by .eleventy.js. The code looks like this now:\n\n\n var environ = process.env.ELEVENTY_ENV;\n console.log(\"ELEVENTY_ENV is: \", environ);\n if (environ == \"dev\") {\n   post_limit = 6;\n } else {\n   post_limit = 'all';\n }\n\n collection = await api.posts\n   .browse({\n     filter: \"tag:-micropost\",\n     include: \"tags,authors\",\n     limit: post_limit\n   })\n...\n\n\n\nImplement robust site search.\n\n\nJust like it says ^^^ there. Using Lunr, Pagefind, something else?\n\n\n☑️ Solved 20-Apr-2023: This is done and I did indeed use Pagefind for the solution. The details can be found elsewhere in this blog at Searching for a Search Solution and also in this blog project's README.md file.\n\n\n\n\nAdd For Sale and OneTab content types.\n\n\nMy old Hugo blog distinguished between a \"post\" and other types that I called \"micropost\" and \"onetab\". Each type had its own unique metadata fields. For example, each \"micropost\" had location: and detailed published-date: fields, but no title:. See https://ghost.org/docs/themes/routing for possible guidance.\n\n\nSee my previous \"Add Micropost and OneTab content types\" solution below for guidance.\n\n\n☑️ Solved 6-Apr-2023: Ok, the micropost and for_sale portions of this is done, and documented (somewhat) in https://github.com/SummittDweller/blog-eleventy-ghost/blob/main/README.md. Note that in the end I introduced a new for_sale tag (note that it's all lowercase to set it apart from others) after trying to use other techniques.\n\n\nI'm pushing the addtion of a onetab content type back up into this list, again.\n\n\nImprove Front Matter Processing\n\n\nThis effort will make a significant change to the solution shown in \"Add and process post front matter\" below. Specifically, I'm going to move the \"front matter\" for all content types out of the excerpt, because it's difficult/impossible to edit excerpts in my iPhone's Ghost Publisher software, and put it at the bottom of the content body with a --- seperator marking the start of the data. It should look something like this example:\n\n\n---\nlocation: Toledo, IA\nprice: $50.00\nnote: This is just a note.\n\n\n\nBasically, anything found at the bottom of a post, of any TYPE, below a --- delimiter, becomes a key:value pair available in post.data.<key>.\n\n\n☑️ Solved 5-Apr-2023: This is done but not as originally planned, and it may still need some work. So, in the end I introduced a new for_sale tag (note that like micropost it's all lowercase to set it apart from others) after trying to use other techniques.\n\n\nMy new \"rear matter\" solution, detailed in the project's README.md file, actually uses a dash-slash-dash delimiter at the bottom of the content body, immediately followed by a slash-dash-slash delimiter... all run together in 6 characters, no spaces.\n\n\nThe first delimiter marks the end of the content, while the second one marks the start of the \"rear matter\". I can't show you explicitly how that works here because putting those characters into a post like this will cause errant processing on this post. 🙃\n\n\nAdd Micropost and OneTab content types.\n\n\nMy old Hugo blog distinguished between a \"post\" and other types that I called \"micropost\" and \"onetab\". Each type had its own unique metadata fields. For example, each \"micropost\" had location: and detailed published-date: fields, but no title:. See https://ghost.org/docs/themes/routing for possible guidance.\n\n\n☑️ Solved 2-Apr-2023: Ok, the micropost portion of this is done, and it's documented (somewhat) in https://github.com/SummittDweller/blog-eleventy-ghost/blob/main/README.md. Note that in the end I introduced a new micropost tag (note that it's all lowercase to set it apart from others) after trying to use other techniques like bits of excerpt and internal tags like #micropost.\n\n\nI'm pushing the addtion of a onetab content type back up into this list, and will add a new for-sale tag and type to the mix.\n\n\nSupport better bulk ingest of content.\n\n\nI have a lot of old blog posts to enter here, and research tells me that capability might be lacking. Perhaps I can construct something using https://ghost.org/docs/admin-api/javascript/ or provide an update of https://github.com/dumrauf/post2ghost that works with the newest Ghost API?\n\n\n☑️ Solved 2-Apr-2023: Well, I got this done after several failures. Ultimately look to https://github.com/SummittDweller/migrate-hugo-to-ghost and more recently, https://github.com/SummittDweller/migrate-html-to-ghost for my solution.\n\n\n\n\nInvestigate using \"special control\" tags.\n\n\nControl Ghost and Eleventy behavior using tags that with @, #, or some other special character. For example: #Micropost, or $Micropost.\n\n\n🚫 CANCELED 26-Mar-2023: Now that front matter via the excerpt is working, I don't think this will be necessary.\n\n\n\n\nAdd FontAwesome support for emoji.\n\n\nI really miss those from my Hugo days, and they would be so handy to have for things like checking items off this list! See https://ghost.org/tutorials/add-social-media-icons/ for guidance.\n\n\nLooks like this is already avaialble in 11ty, https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vidhill/fortawesome-free-regular-11ty-shortcode, but can I code a shortcode call in Ghost and pass it through? I'll bet not... NOPE.\n\n\n☑️ Solved 26-Mar-2023: This turned out to be a bit of a gut 🥊. So, I've scrapped the idea in favor of just using CTRL - COMMAND - SPACE on my Mac.\n\n\n\n\nAdd and process post front matter.\n\n\nSee https://forum.ghost.org/t/custom-data-fields/8884/4 and https://github.com/nchaulet/ghost-app-frontmatter. Maybe this old project can be resurected and implemented here so that posts, and other types, can have robust \"front matter\" with custom display.\n\n\n☑️ Solved 26-Mar-2023: Following the logic of the parseFrontMatter function in https://github.com/nchaulet/ghost-app-frontmatter/blob/master/index.js, I added the following code to .eleventy.js.\n\n\n// Add front matter processing of Ghost posts here, \n// pulling data from the `post.excerpt`\n// Note that pulling from `post.codeinjection_head` and\n// `post.custom_excerpt` did NOT work!\n      \n// console.log(post);\n// console.log(\"Before:\", post.excerpt);\nvar parsed = matter(post.excerpt, { delims: ['---', '---'] });\npost.data = parsed.data;\nvar removed = post.excerpt.replace(/---[\\S\\s]*---/m, '');\npost.excerpt = removed;\n\n// console.log(\"After:\", post.excerpt);\n// console.log(\"Data:\", post.data);\n\n\n\nIt looks for typical --- delimiters in the excerpt portion of a post and parses it into data.<element> key:value pairs that are available to my templates.\n\n\n\n\nDisplay publication and last-mod dates.\n\n\nJust what the title says. Displaying these things was something my old Hugo blog always did.\n\n\n☑️ Solved 26-Mar-2023: Another easy addition in src/_includes/partials/card.njk where the Nunjucks now checks for matching published_at and updated_at dates, and reports \"Published\" if they match, or \"Updated\" if they don't. Also, microposts now show differnt data, including location: and the publication date AND time.\n\n\n\n\nImprove the display of tags.\n\n\nMaybe seperate tags using &middot; symbols · like · this? Perhaps have a look at https://ghost.org/docs/themes/helpers/tags/.\n\n\n☑️ Solved 25-Mar-2023: An easy addition in src/_includes/partials/card.njk where the Nunjucks now looks like this:\n\n\n<div class=\"post-card-tags\">\n  {% if post.tags %}\n    {% for tag in post.tags %}\n      {{ tag.name }} {% if not loop.last %} &middot; {% endif %}\n    {% endfor %}\n  {% endif %}\n</div>\n\n\n\nRebuild and deploy the site when content is published.\n\n\nThe site already builds and auto-deploys when changes are pushed to the code/structure, but the forerunner of this site also included a hook that did a build and deploy (per Netlify) when changes to the Ghost content are published. See https://github.com/TryGhost/eleventy-starter-ghost for possible guidance.\n\n\nBetter yet, check out https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#operation/apps_create_deployment. It seems the mechanism that's required here is to make a request, like a curl or POST, to a particular URL (see sample below) perhaps with an auth token included for security.\n\n\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN\" \\\n  \"https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/apps/{app_id}/deployments\"\n\n\n\nNow, the question is, how to make my Ghost install dispatch such a request? Simple, see https://ghost.org/docs/webhooks/ but note that the request might need to be a POST, not a curl.\n\n\nHmmm, this is more difficult than I imagined, so this write-up might soon become a post of its own!\n\n\nPreliminary Findings\n\n\nUnfortunately, it looks like Ghost's webhooks don't integrate well with DigitalOcean. DO requires a POST request that looks like this in curl form:\n\n\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer { $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN }\" \\\n  -d '{ \"force_build\":true }' \\\n  \"https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/apps/{ app ID }/deployments\"\n\n\n\nI can't find a way to build such a request in Ghost since the headers and body of the webhooks it builds don't look like what you see above. The only thing that can be easily configured in a Ghost webhook is the destination address. So, now I'm going to look into the possibility of using an iOS or MacOS app that triggers a curl like the one you see above. Or, maybe I can add a protected page to the site itself and embed a Javascript POST request within?\n\n\n☑️ Solved 23-Mar-2023: Please see Built by Webhook + Password Protection for all the gory details.\n\n\n\nForce rebuild with \"Trigger Site Update\" draft.\n\n\nThe idea here is to delay rebuilding the site until triggered by an editor, perhaps using a \"special\" trigger post. This could help avoid multipe back-to-back rebuilds when lots of content is updated in a short period of time. Of course, if a \"special\" post were used for this it would have to be implicitly \"ignored\" and always in a \"draft\" state.\n\n\n🚫 CANCELED 23-Mar-2023: No longer needed. Please see Built by Webhook + Password Protection for all the gory details.\n\n\n\nEngage spell checking.\n\n\nIndications from as early as 2015 indicate that this should work straight from the browser, but I'm not so sure?\n\n\n☑️ Solved 23-Mar-2023: Just toggle the little abc-checkmark icon down in the lower right corner of the editor window. Also, the question-mark icon down there is helpful too!\n\n\n",

Let me explain…\n\nGeorgie is the best-tempered cat I have ever known. 😸 She’s a little over a year old now so she still loves to play, and she’s made a habit of insisting that I hold her at least a couple of times each day, and give her kitty treats in exchange for snuggles. We captured Georgie in December 2019, she was the last of 3 kittens and 5 adult cats (Uno, Deuce, Tres, Veer and Go) that we caught as part of a TNR (Trap, Neuter and Release) effort that we started as the weather started to turn colder. Georgie’s siblings found homes at the Tama Co. Humane Shelter (and later with a family in Belle Plaine) and with Morgan, who adpoted “Lint”, a long-haired solid gray kitten that was an odd part of the short-haired tuxedo cats living next door.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgie was the last of the 8 cats that we caught and she managed to avoid the traps quite well. Since we were concerned for her wellbeing, as she was all alone, we decided to try and catch her without a trap, and managed to do so after she elluded us for an hour or so. She managed to get away by ducking into a storm sewer opening down the street, that’s why we named her Georgie, after the poor little boy featured in the opening of King’s story, “It”. Like “It”, she’s also a “collector”, always picking things up and carrying them away to who-knows-where. 😄\n\nJo, or JoJo, or Joey, or Cujo, is the new addition to the family. 🐱 Even before Stitch passed we put the word out that we might be looking for another kitty, somebody to keep Georgie company when no humans are home. Well, we received word of a farm kitten looking for a home and paid it a visit one week ago on Thursday night, November 19. Stitch passed the next evening and on Sunday, November 22nd, the kitten came to live with us. She saw the vet on Monday for an initial checkup and she’s sequestered in a spare bedroom for about 2 weeks to give her eyes and nose a chance to clear up… that process has started but she’s still got some eye goop as you can see.\n\n\n\n\n\nMackenzie suggested we name her “Cujo” since the farmer’s dog got hold of her in the farmyard. Also, Stephen King. 😄 The farmer was going to keep her as an indoor kitty due to the dog incident, but was overruled by her spouse. Their loss, our gain. We decided that the name could also stand for “Cute Jo”, and that stuck, along with all the other forms of the name. Jo is all kitten, but not afraid of anyone. She’s quick to snuggle up, but also loves to claw and bite when she’s in a mood to play. We are trying to teach her that toys=play while toes=snuggles, and the same for other body parts. I think she’ll come around just fine. Just wish she didn’t have to quarantine for another 10 days. 😦 But of course, it’s #2020.\n\nThat’s a wrap. Until next time… but only after I play with Georgie and give Jo another snuggle.\n\n",

But I never got the CMS to work in production with this blog’s App on <a href='https://www.digitalocean.com/'><em>DigitalOcean</em></a> (<em>DO</em>). I should note that <em>DO</em>’s support folks were very helpful, but in the end I think all of the client-side stuff that <em>Netlify CMS</em> is doing was more than they were willing (capable?) of helping me overcome. That’s probably my fault more than their’s; client-side isn’t my strong suit.</p><p>In the week since then I have, however, been able to stand up a new working copy of the <a href='https://wieting.Tama-Toledo.com'><em>Wieting Theatre</em> website</a> on <a href='https://www.netlify.com/'><em>Netlify.com</em></a>, where it enjoys the same kind of automated builds and automatic deployment that I previously found at <em>DO</em>.  The big difference, at Netlify.com my <em>Netlify CMS</em> depoloyment works locally AND in production, giving me the ability to allow content editors, even those who don’t have a <em>Netlify.com</em> or <em>GitHub</em> account, to do what they do best, edit their content.</p><h2 id='the-_wieting-theatre_s-new-site-and-the-_crb_'>The <em>Wieting Theatre</em>’s New Site, and the <em>CRB</em></h2><p>So this post started as a brain dump, chronicling how I got <a href='https://Wieting.Tama-Toledo.com'>https://Wieting.Tama-Toledo.com</a> to work.  But, instead of hashing out how I “did” it, I’m going to show you how I’m doing something similar, for a site that features the <em>Compass Rose Band</em>, or <em>CRB</em>, my brother-in-law’s band out of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.</p><h2 id='netlify-identity'>Netlify Identity</h2><p>I think the real key to all of this is a <em>Netlify.com</em> agent called <a href='https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/'><em>Netlify Identity</em></a>. From the <em>Netlify.com</em> site and documentation…</p><div class='original'><p><em>Netlify Identity</em> service brings a full suite of authentication functionality, backed by the <em>GoTrue</em> API. This allows you to manage and authenticate users on your site or app, without requiring them to be users of <em>Netlify</em> or any other service. You can use this for gated content, site administration, and more.</p></div><p>In theory, <em>Netlify Identity</em> can be deployed anywhere, but in practice, setting it up can be quite tricky (at least it was for me).  That’s where <em>Netlify.com</em> shines, and that’s understandable since they created both <em>Netlify CMS</em> and <em>Netlify Identity</em>. The two creations play well together, and make life easier for a devops like me. Well played indeed.</p><p>If you read my previous post you know that in a <a href='https://gohugo.io'><em>Hugo</em></a> site, like this one, the <code>./static/admin/config.yml</code> file holds all of your CMS info.  If you host content on <em>Netlify.com</em> with <em>Netlify CMS</em> and <em>Netlify Identity</em> engaged, all you really need in that config file is something like this:</p><pre tabindex='0'><code>backend:  name: git-gateway  branch: main...</code></pre><p>The rest of the CMS “magic” takes place in a server-side access manager that you can find at your <em>Netlify.com</em> site folder at <code>https://app.netlify.com/sites/[site-name]/identity</code>.  The client-side of the access/identity equation can be handled with an app template, and you can choose from many starter templates found at <a href='https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template'>Start with a Template</a>.</p><h3 id='external-oauth-without-_netlifycom_'>External OAuth without <em>Netlify.com</em></h3><p>If you wish to proceed without using <em>Netlify.com</em> as your host, you’ll find a number of options at <a href='https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/external-oauth-clients/'>External OAuth Client</a>. Beware, this option isn’t for a server-side guy like me, and the <em>Netlify.com</em> option is quick, easy, and cheap… at least I think so.</p><h2 id='building-a-new-_compass-rose-band_-site-on-_netlifycom_'>Building a New <em>Compass Rose Band</em> Site on <em>Netlify.com</em></h2><p>Rather than rehashing the story of my <em>Wieting Theatre</em> migration to <em>Netlify.com</em>, I’m going to repeat that process and capture the journey while migrating our existing <em>Compass Rose Band</em> site from <em>DO</em>.</p><h3 id='using-_netlifycom_-and-one-click-hugo-cms'>Using <em>Netlify.com</em> and <code>one-click-hugo-cms</code></h3><p>From the <a href='https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template'>Start with a Template</a> I clicked the <code>Deploy to Netlify</code> button under the ‘Hugo Site Starter’ option. This was super easy since <em>Netlify.com</em> already knows me… because I created a free account about a week ago. That selection took me to a screen where I was asked to identify a new <em>Github</em> repostory. Again, super easy because I had already logged in to <em>Github</em> earlier.</p><p>The default name for this new repository is <code>one-click-hugo-cms</code>, same as the template repository it will be built from. I choose to name my new repo <code>compass-rose-band-one-click</code>, for obvious reasons. That repository can be found at <a href='https://github.com/SummittDweller/compass-rose-band-one-click'>https://github.com/SummittDweller/compass-rose-band-one-click</a> where the <code>README.md</code> file is titled “Hugo template for Netlify CMS with Netlify Identity”. The initial repository contents looked like this:</p><p><figure><img alt='one-click-hugo-cms' src='http://localhost:1313/img/one-click-hugo-cms.png'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><h3 id='replacing-the-site'>Replacing the <code>/site</code></h3><p>A default <em>Hugo</em> site is automatically built and deployed for you as part of the one-click process, and <em>Netlify.com</em> will supply an address so you can see your creation. But that’s not the <em>Compass Rose Band</em>! No problem, I found it quick and easy to replace the default template site by first cloning my new repo to my workstation, and replacing the <code>/site</code> directory with my own contents.  It went like this…</p><ul><li><code>cd ~/GitHub</code>  ⬅ This is where I keep local copies of all my GitHub projects.</li><li><code>git clone https://github.com/SummittDweller/compass-rose-band-one-click</code></li><li><code>cd compass-rose-band-one-click</code></li><li><code>git branch -m master main</code>  ⬅ Optional step, changes my local branch name to ‘main’.</li><li><code>rm -fr site/*</code>  ⬅ Remove the template site, the contents of <code>/site</code>.</li><li><code>cp -fr ~/GitHub/compass-rose-band/* site/.</code>  ⬅ Copy my local CRB site<sup>*</sup> to <code>/site</code>.</li></ul><p><sup>*</sup>Note that copying in the manner excludes all . files and directories, so the <code>.git</code> folder is NOT copied. This is IMPORTANT!</p><p>At this point, your old site has a new home in <code>./site</code> so if you navigate there and do <code>hugo server</code> you should see a local instance of the site.  Like so…</p><ul><li><code>cd site</code></li><li><code>hugo server</code></li><li>Visit <code>localhost:1313</code>, or whatever localhost site is indicated, to see your site.</li></ul><h3 id='pushing-the-site-to-_github_'>Pushing the Site to <em>Github</em></h3><p>So, now your <em>Netlify.com</em> project lives in a directory like my <code>~/GitHub/compass-rose-band-one-click</code>, and the corresponding <em>Hugo</em> site contents are in the <code>./site</code> folder there. To deploy this new copy of your site to <em>Netlify.com</em> simply do like this…</p><ul><li><code>cd ~/GitHub/compass-rose-band-one-click</code></li><li><code>git add .</code></li><li><code>git commit -m 'Now with CRB site contents in ./site'</code></li><li><code>git push -u origin main</code></li></ul><h3 id='deploying-the-site-on-_netlifycom_'>Deploying the Site on <em>Netlify.com</em></h3><p>By default, pushing your changes to <em>Github</em> will automatically deploy them to your <em>Netlify.com</em> site, but you pushed to <code>main</code>, not <code>master</code>, so no synchornization is likely. But that’s easy to fix.</p><p>Navigate your browser to your <em>Netlify.com</em> “team” page, find your new project there, and click on <code>Site Settings</code>. Next you’ll see options for things like changing the name of your project and site.  I changed mine to <code>compass-rose-band-one-click</code> to match my <em>Github</em> repo name.</p><p>Visit the <code>Build &amp; Deploy</code> link in the menu on the left side of the page, find the <code>Deploy contexts</code> info and click <code>Edit settings</code> there so you can change the production branch setting from <code>master</code> to <code>main</code>.  Leave the default setting of “Any pull request against your production branch / branch deploy branches” selected.</p><p>Next, visit the “Deploys” page in your <em>Netlify.com</em> project page at <code>https://app.netlify.com/sites/[project-name]/deploys</code>, mine is <a href='https://app.netlify.com/sites/compass-rose-band-one-click/deploys'>https://app.netlify.com/sites/compass-rose-band-one-click/deploys</a>, and click the <code>Trigger deploy</code> button there.  You should then see a log of the deployment as it runs, and this time it should target your new <code>main</code> branch with your updated <code>./site</code> contents.</p><p>If successful you should see a screen featuring a block like this one:</p><p><figure><img alt='Successfuly deployed on &lt;em&gt;Netlify.com&lt;/em&gt;' src='http://localhost:1313/img/netlify-preview-deploy.png'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>Click on the <code>Preview deploy ⬈</code> link and voilà, your site!</p><h2 id='now_netlify-cms_'>Now…<em>Netlify CMS</em></h2><p>It’s getting late on this Sunday night so I’ll share the first few lines from the latest copy of my new project’s <code>./site/static/admin/config.yml</code> file for <em>Netlify CMS</em>.</p><pre tabindex='0'><code>backend:  name: git-gateway  branch: main## To make local_backend mode work you must run 'npx netlify-cms-proxy-server' in its own terminal window##   from the project root.  See https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/beta-features/ for details.local_backend: truemedia_folder: site/static/img    public_folder: /img...</code></pre><h3 id='whats-all-that'>What’s All That?</h3><p>I’m back, as promised, and you’re probably asking what all that stuff in the <code>config.yml</code> file is doing? Well, as mentioned earlier, the simple <code>backend:</code> section (first three lines) links the CMS to the <code>main</code> branch of our new <em>Github</em> project.  The rest isn’t required, unless you also want to use the CMS on a local clone of the project, like when making mass edits locally.</p><p>Let me try to explain.</p><h3 id='local_backend-a-_netlify-cms_-beta-feature'><code>local_backend:</code> A <em>Netlify CMS</em> Beta Feature</h3><p>If you visit the <em>Netlify CMS</em>’ <a href='https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/beta-features/'>Beta Features!</a> pages you’ll see <code>local_backend</code> mentioned near the very top. [<em>Note that as a beta feature this information is bound to move at some point.</em>] That feature enables configuration of an option to make the CMS avaialble when working locally on a cloned, presumably, copy of the <em>Github</em> repository.  The beta documentation mentions running <code>npx netlify-cms-proxy-server</code> as part of the process.</p><h3 id='a-local-problem-with-site--no-not-really'>A Local Problem with <code>./site</code>?  No, Not Really</h3><p>So, in the local clone of my new <em>Compass Rose Band</em> one-click <em>Hugo</em> website, the “one-click” <em>Netlify CMS</em> parts live in the project’s root directory, and the <em>Hugo</em> site lives just “below” it in <code>./site</code>.  Accordingly my <code>media_folder:</code> setting shown above includes the <code>site/</code> prefix, and the same is true of all the <code>config.yml</code> keys that end in <code>folder:</code>.  This is correct for production, and it also works with a local clone IF I launch things correctly!</p><p><em>Hugo</em> and the <code>hugo server</code> command that I need to preview local changes demands that I either <code>cd site</code> before I run it, or override the command’s path by specifying <code>hugo server -s site</code>.  Only this 2nd approach works!</p><p>So the process that’s needed for local development and testing, including <em>Netlify CMS</em> looks like this for me:</p><ul><li>If I don’t yet have the project locally I will begin with…<code>cd ~/GitHub; git clone --recursive https://github.com/SummittDweller/compass-rose-band-one-click; cd compass-rose-band-one-click</code></li><li>If I already have a local clone I’ll do this…<code>cd ~/GitHub/compass-rose-band-one-click; git pull</code></li></ul><p>From here on out there’s just one process, like so…</p><ul><li><code>npx netlify-cms-proxy-server</code>   ⬅ In a new terminal window. See next section of this post.</li><li><code>atom .</code>  ⬅ Launch <em>Atom</em> in the working directory.</li><li><code>hugo server -s site</code>  ⬅ <strong>Important:</strong> Don’t forget the <code>-s site</code> option!</li><li>Create and edit files as needed. Changes should be immediately visible in <code>http://localhost:1313</code>.</li><li>To edit or create content using <em>Netlify CMS</em>, just visit <code>http://localhost:1313/admin/</code>.</li><li>When all changes are complete…<ul><li><code>git add .</code></li><li><code>git commit -m 'a brief message here'</code></li><li><code>git push</code></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id='requires-_npx_-part-of-_nodejs_'>Requires <em>npx</em>, Part of <em>Node.js</em></h3><p>The <code>npx</code> command mentioned above requires that <em>npx</em> be installed, and it’s part of <em>Node.js</em>.  To make it run properly I followed guidance from <a href='https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html'>https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html</a> to ensure both were installed.  In at least one instance I also had to run <code>brew upgrade node</code> and <code>npm i -g npx</code> to ensure that <em>Node.js</em> was up-to-date, and that <em>npx</em> was available as needed.</p><p>The <code>npx netlify-cms-proxy-server</code>, loads and runs the <em>netlify-cms-proxy-server</em> script, and in doing so it will tie up your terminal window.  So, it’s best to <strong>do this in a separate terminal window!</strong>  Don’t put the command in the background (using a <code>&amp;</code> flag at the end) as this won’t allow you to see if the command is working properly. When you run this command you should see some feedback from the script indicating what it is doing. The script binds to your working directory then effectively routes all <em>Netlify CMS</em> actions, performed in this instance via <code>http://localhost:1313/admin/</code>, to the local <em>git</em> repo there.</p><h2 id='ok-now-we-need-a-proper-domain'>Ok, Now We Need a Proper Domain</h2><p>So, in its original form the <em>Compass Rose Band</em> site is aliased to three different domains:</p><ul><li><a href='https://compassroseband.net'>https://compassroseband.net</a>,</li><li><a href='https://thecompassroseband.com'>https://thecompassroseband.com</a>, and</li><li><a href='https://thecompassroseband.net'>https://thecompassroseband.net</a></li></ul><p>I choose to try migrating these domains to the new <em>Netlify.com</em> site one-at-a-time, starting with the least-used domain, <em>thecompassroseband.net</em>.</p><p>To do this I started by visiting my <em>Netlify.com</em> account/team and the <code>Domains</code> menu, then my project-specific domain settings at <a href='https://app.netlify.com/teams/summittdweller/dns/thecompassroseband.net'>https://app.netlify.com/teams/summittdweller/dns/thecompassroseband.net</a>.  In this page I’m given a list of 4 <em>Netlify.com</em> name servers that I can use for this particular project.

But that’s not the <em>Compass Rose Band</em>! No problem, I found it quick and easy to replace the default template site by first cloning my new repo to my workstation, and replacing the <code>/site</code> directory with my own contents.  It went like this…</p><ul><li><code>cd ~/GitHub</code>  ⬅ This is where I keep local copies of all my GitHub projects.</li><li><code>git clone https://github.com/SummittDweller/compass-rose-band-one-click</code></li><li><code>cd compass-rose-band-one-click</code></li><li><code>git branch -m master main</code>  ⬅ Optional step, changes my local branch name to ‘main’.</li><li><code>rm -fr site/*</code>  ⬅ Remove the template site, the contents of <code>/site</code>.</li><li><code>cp -fr ~/GitHub/compass-rose-band/* site/.</code>  ⬅ Copy my local CRB site<sup>*</sup> to <code>/site</code>.</li></ul><p><sup>*</sup>Note that copying in the manner excludes all . files and directories, so the <code>.git</code> folder is NOT copied. This is IMPORTANT!</p><p>At this point, your old site has a new home in <code>./site</code> so if you navigate there and do <code>hugo server</code> you should see a local instance of the site.  Like so…</p><ul><li><code>cd site</code></li><li><code>hugo server</code></li><li>Visit <code>localhost:1313</code>, or whatever localhost site is indicated, to see your site.</li></ul><h3 id='pushing-the-site-to-_github_'>Pushing the Site to <em>Github</em></h3><p>So, now your <em>Netlify.com</em> project lives in a directory like my <code>~/GitHub/compass-rose-band-one-click</code>, and the corresponding <em>Hugo</em> site contents are in the <code>./site</code> folder there. To deploy this new copy of your site to <em>Netlify.com</em> simply do like this…</p><ul><li><code>cd ~/GitHub/compass-rose-band-one-click</code></li><li><code>git add .</code></li><li><code>git commit -m 'Now with CRB site contents in ./site'</code></li><li><code>git push -u origin main</code></li></ul><h3 id='deploying-the-site-on-_netlifycom_'>Deploying the Site on <em>Netlify.com</em></h3><p>By default, pushing your changes to <em>Github</em> will automatically deploy them to your <em>Netlify.com</em> site, but you pushed to <code>main</code>, not <code>master</code>, so no synchornization is likely. But that’s easy to fix.</p><p>Navigate your browser to your <em>Netlify.com</em> “team” page, find your new project there, and click on <code>Site Settings</code>.

            "plaintext": "In my last post, Adding Netlify CMS for Editing This Blog, I was able to successfully engage the Netlify CMS with a “local” copy of this blog. But I never got the CMS to work in production with this blog’s App on DigitalOcean (DO). I should note that DO’s support folks were very helpful, but in the end I think all of the client-side stuff that Netlify CMS is doing was more than they were willing (capable?) of helping me overcome. That’s probably my fault more than their’s; client-side isn’t my strong suit.\n\nIn the week since then I have, however, been able to stand up a new working copy of the Wieting Theatre website on Netlify.com, where it enjoys the same kind of automated builds and automatic deployment that I previously found at DO. The big difference, at Netlify.com my Netlify CMS depoloyment works locally AND in production, giving me the ability to allow content editors, even those who don’t have a Netlify.com or GitHub account, to do what they do best, edit their content.\n\n\nThe Wieting Theatre’s New Site, and the CRB\n\nSo this post started as a brain dump, chronicling how I got https://Wieting.Tama-Toledo.com to work. But, instead of hashing out how I “did” it, I’m going to show you how I’m doing something similar, for a site that features the Compass Rose Band, or CRB, my brother-in-law’s band out of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\n\n\nNetlify Identity\n\nI think the real key to all of this is a Netlify.com agent called Netlify Identity. From the Netlify.com site and documentation…\n\nNetlify Identity service brings a full suite of authentication functionality, backed by the GoTrue API. This allows you to manage and authenticate users on your site or app, without requiring them to be users of Netlify or any other service. You can use this for gated content, site administration, and more.\n\nIn theory, Netlify Identity can be deployed anywhere, but in practice, setting it up can be quite tricky (at least it was for me). That’s where Netlify.com shines, and that’s understandable since they created both Netlify CMS and Netlify Identity. The two creations play well together, and make life easier for a devops like me. Well played indeed.\n\nIf you read my previous post you know that in a Hugo site, like this one, the ./static/admin/config.yml file holds all of your CMS info. If you host content on Netlify.com with Netlify CMS and Netlify Identity engaged, all you really need in that config file is something like this:\n\nbackend:  name: git-gateway  branch: main...\n\nThe rest of the CMS “magic” takes place in a server-side access manager that you can find at your Netlify.com site folder at https://app.netlify.com/sites/[site-name]/identity. The client-side of the access/identity equation can be handled with an app template, and you can choose from many starter templates found at Start with a Template.\n\n\nExternal OAuth without Netlify.com\n\nIf you wish to proceed without using Netlify.com as your host, you’ll find a number of options at External OAuth Client. Beware, this option isn’t for a server-side guy like me, and the Netlify.com option is quick, easy, and cheap… at least I think so.\n\n\nBuilding a New Compass Rose Band Site on Netlify.com\n\nRather than rehashing the story of my Wieting Theatre migration to Netlify.com, I’m going to repeat that process and capture the journey while migrating our existing Compass Rose Band site from DO.\n\n\nUsing Netlify.com and one-click-hugo-cms\n\nFrom the Start with a Template I clicked the Deploy to Netlify button under the ‘Hugo Site Starter’ option. This was super easy since Netlify.com already knows me… because I created a free account about a week ago. That selection took me to a screen where I was asked to identify a new Github repostory. Again, super easy because I had already logged in to Github earlier.\n\nThe default name for this new repository is one-click-hugo-cms, same as the template repository it will be built from. I choose to name my new repo compass-rose-band-one-click, for obvious reasons. That repository can be found at https://github.com/SummittDweller/compass-rose-band-one-click where the README.md file is titled “Hugo template for Netlify CMS with Netlify Identity”. The initial repository contents looked like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing the /site\n\nA default Hugo site is automatically built and deployed for you as part of the one-click process, and Netlify.com will supply an address so you can see your creation. But that’s not the Compass Rose Band! No problem, I found it quick and easy to replace the default template site by first cloning my new repo to my workstation, and replacing the /site directory with my own contents. It went like this…\n\n * cd ~/GitHub ⬅ This is where I keep local copies of all my GitHub projects.\n * git clone https://github.com/SummittDweller/compass-rose-band-one-click\n * cd compass-rose-band-one-click\n * git branch -m master main ⬅ Optional step, changes my local branch name to ‘main’.\n * rm -fr site/* ⬅ Remove the template site, the contents of /site.\n * cp -fr ~/GitHub/compass-rose-band/* site/. ⬅ Copy my local CRB site* to /site.\n\n*Note that copying in the manner excludes all . files and directories, so the .git folder is NOT copied. This is IMPORTANT!\n\nAt this point, your old site has a new home in ./site so if you navigate there and do hugo server you should see a local instance of the site. Like so…\n\n * cd site\n * hugo server\n * Visit localhost:1313, or whatever localhost site is indicated, to see your site.\n\n\nPushing the Site to Github\n\nSo, now your Netlify.com project lives in a directory like my ~/GitHub/compass-rose-band-one-click, and the corresponding Hugo site contents are in the ./site folder there. To deploy this new copy of your site to Netlify.com simply do like this…\n\n * cd ~/GitHub/compass-rose-band-one-click\n * git add .\n * git commit -m 'Now with CRB site contents in ./site'\n * git push -u origin main\n\n\nDeploying the Site on Netlify.com\n\nBy default, pushing your changes to Github will automatically deploy them to your Netlify.com site, but you pushed to main, not master, so no synchornization is likely. But that’s easy to fix.\n\nNavigate your browser to your Netlify.com “team” page, find your new project there, and click on Site Settings. Next you’ll see options for things like changing the name of your project and site. I changed mine to compass-rose-band-one-click to match my Github repo name.\n\nVisit the Build & Deploy link in the menu on the left side of the page, find the Deploy contexts info and click Edit settings there so you can change the production branch setting from master to main. Leave the default setting of “Any pull request against your production branch / branch deploy branches” selected.\n\nNext, visit the “Deploys” page in your Netlify.com project page at https://app.netlify.com/sites/[project-name]/deploys, mine is https://app.netlify.com/sites/compass-rose-band-one-click/deploys, and click the Trigger deploy button there. You should then see a log of the deployment as it runs, and this time it should target your new main branch with your updated ./site contents.\n\nIf successful you should see a screen featuring a block like this one:\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the Preview deploy ⬈ link and voilà, your site!\n\n\nNow…Netlify CMS\n\nIt’s getting late on this Sunday night so I’ll share the first few lines from the latest copy of my new project’s ./site/static/admin/config.yml file for Netlify CMS.\n\nbackend:  name: git-gateway  branch: main## To make local_backend mode work you must run 'npx netlify-cms-proxy-server' in its own terminal window##   from the project root.

[Note that as a beta feature this information is bound to move at some point.] That feature enables configuration of an option to make the CMS avaialble when working locally on a cloned, presumably, copy of the Github repository. The beta documentation mentions running npx netlify-cms-proxy-server as part of the process.\n\n\nA Local Problem with ./site? No, Not Really\n\nSo, in the local clone of my new Compass Rose Band one-click Hugo website, the “one-click” Netlify CMS parts live in the project’s root directory, and the Hugo site lives just “below” it in ./site. Accordingly my media_folder: setting shown above includes the site/ prefix, and the same is true of all the config.yml keys that end in folder:.

It’s true, I have been thinking about moving that site to make it static, almost certainly using <em>Hugo</em>, but I thought before doing so I’d give <em>Drupal 8</em> one more try.  I’m pleased to report that it’s working nicely again.  Here’s how I did it, and how I plan to keep it updated…</p><h2 id='saved-by-docker-compose-drupal'>Saved by “docker-compose-drupal”</h2><p>I actually started the process of migrating and updating <a href='https://wieting.tamatoledo.com'>the Wieting website</a> in <em>Docksal</em>, but I failed… I could never figure out how to reliably and easily push my work to production from there.  <em>Docksal</em> just seems to wrap so much of itself into the <code>cli</code> container that drives it, I found it difficult to de-couple from that in production.</p><p>So I went looking elsewhere and discovered <a href='https://devwithlando.org'>Lando</a>, and I did considerable work with it because <em>Lando</em>, at least in the case of <em>Drupal</em>, builds a 3-part development stack that looks a lot like what I wanted to deploy in production.  The parts of a <em>Lando</em> stack, and my production stack, are the same:</p><ul><li>An <code>nginx</code> web server container,</li><li>A <code>mysql</code> or <code>mariadb</code> database container, and</li><li>A <code>php</code> codebase container.</li></ul><p>But once again I had trouble figuring out exactly how to push that development stack to production.  So, I went looking again for an open (and by that I mean “free” and freely modifiable) production-ready stack configuration that uses the 3-parts I had in mind.  I found <a href='https://github.com/mogtofu33/docker-compose-drupal'>docker-compose-drupal</a> and almost immediately created <a href='https://github.com/SummittDweller/docker-compose-drupal'>my own fork</a> of that project. Using <a href='https://github.com/SummittDweller/docker-compose-drupal'>my <code>docker-compose-drupal</code> fork</a> I set off to build a production instance, NOT a development instance, on my <code>summitt-dweller-DO-docker</code> droplet at <em>DigitalOcean</em>.  That project came to life in <code>/opt/docker-compose-drupal</code> there.</p><p>The evolution of <code>summitt-dweller-DO-docker:/opt/docker-compose-drupal</code> was quite an adventure, in large part because the <em>Wieting’s</em> web site had gone almost a year without any updates.  That meant upgrading the <em>Drupal</em> core from version 8.2.? to version 8.8.2, along with countless modules that had changed rather dramatically, so there were lots of bumps along the way.  I also had to move the site from a multi-site configuration, the old site lived in a container at <code>/var/www/html/web/sites/wieting</code>, to a <em>default</em> configuration that lives in the container at <code>/var/www/localhost/web/sites/default</code>.</p><p>Fortunately, <a href='https://github.com/mogtofu33/docker-compose-drupal'>docker-compose-drupal</a> includes some nice scripts and features to help with things like that, and they are nicely documented in the <a href='https://github.com/mogtofu33/docker-compose-drupal/blob/master/README.md'>project’s README.md</a> file.  I’ll elaborate on a few of the key features later in this post, but most of what I did during the migration and update is water-under-the-bridge, and should not need to be repeated, ever, so I won’t elaborate on all of it here.  It’s worth noting here that the work I did in my fork all happened in a branch named <code>wieting</code>.</p><h2 id='moved-to-wieting-d8-do'>Moved to “wieting-D8-DO”</h2><p>Once I had a new site working as I’d hoped, I wanted to begin a fresh new development and update cycle, so I used a process I’ve documented in my work blog: <a href='https://static.grinnell.edu/blogs/McFateM/posts/065-create-new-github-project-from-a-branch/'>“How to Create a New GitHub Repo from an Existing Branch”</a>. That work created the <em>Wieting</em> site’s new home, <a href='https://github.com/SummittDweller/wieting-D8-DO'>https://github.com/SummittDweller/wieting-D8-DO</a>, based on the <em>wieting</em> branch of the aforementioned fork of <em>docker-compose-drupal</em>.</p><h2 id='site-update-workflow'>Site Update Workflow</h2><p>Having built the <a href='https://github.com/SummittDweller/wieting-D8-DO'>wieting-D8-DO</a> project I need a reliable workflow that I could use to keep it up-to-date.  I created that workflow by migrating the existing production site at <code>summitt-dweller-DO-docker:/opt/docker-compose-drupal</code>, where it responded as <em><a href='https://Wieting.TamaToledo.org'>https://Wieting.TamaToledo.org</a></em>, to a new staging copy at <code>summitt-dweller-DO-docker:/opt/wieting-D8-DO</code>, where it would respond, temporarily, at my designated “staging” address, <em><a href='https://Wieting.SummittServices.com'>https://Wieting.SummittServices.com</a></em>.</p><p>While working as <em>administrator</em> on <code>summitt-dweller-DO-docker</code> the entire command-line process looked like this:</p><pre tabindex='0'><code>echo $(date --iso-8601)cd /opt/docker-compose-drupalgit ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard &gt; $(date --iso-8601).ignored.listtar czvf $(date --iso-8601).ignored.list.tar.gz --files-from $(date --iso-8601).ignored.listgpg --encrypt --recipient summitt.dweller@gmail.com $(date --iso-8601).ignored.list.tar.gzrm -fr $(date --iso-8601).ignored.list.tar.gzcd /optgit clone https://github.com/SummittDweller/wieting-D8-DO.gitcd wieting-D8-DOcp -f ../docker-compose-drupal/2020-02-27.ignored.list.tar.gz.gpg .gpg --decrypt 2020-02-27.ignored.list.tar.gz.gpg &gt; ignored.tar.gztar xzvf ignored.tar.gzrm -f ignored.tar.gzcd ../docker-compose-drupalscripts/mysql dumpmv -f database/dump/dump.sql /opt/wieting-D8-DO/database/mysql-initcd /opt/wieting-D8-DOnano .envnano docker-compose.ymldocker-compose up -d</code></pre><h3 id='breaking-the-workflow-down'>Breaking the Workflow Down</h3><p>Moving the site from <code>/opt/docker-compose-drupal</code> and <a href='https://Wieting.TamaToledo.com'>https://Wieting.TamaToledo.com</a>, to <code>/opt/wieting-D8-DO</code> and <a href='https://Wieting.SummittServices.com'>https://Wieting.SummittServices.com</a> is a command-line process like this, with comments…</p><table><thead><tr><th>Comments / Commands</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td># Set the working directory to the server’s project root, then <code>git clone</code> the <em>wieting-D8-DO</em> project.<br/> <code>cd /opt</code> <br/> <code>git clone https://github.com/SummittDweller/wieting-D8-DO.git</code></td></tr><tr><td># Save today’s date in ISO 8601 format to <code>${today}</code>; we will use it a few times later on. <br/> <code>today=$(date --iso-8601)</code></td></tr><tr><td># Set working directory to the initial project.

We finally got power back on Thursday evening, August 20, so on Friday morning, August 21, 2020, we walked for the first time since the derecho of August 10. It was actually more like an obstacle course than our usual stroll, but we still managed to collect quite a bit of trash, as usual. There were about a dozen places around the lake, a trail that is about 1.33 miles long, where fallen trees required that we climb over or weave around. It’s no fun to do either, especially since the “weaving” sometimes involved venturing off-trail into the poison ivy. Makes me itch just thinking about it.\n\nAt the west end of Cherry Lake I placed a bench and engraved rock as a memorial for my parents, and my son, Ian. The most recent, pre-derecho photo of the rock and bench was taken on a “scurry” walk around the lake early this Spring. Portions of scurry-partners Jeff Shaw, and the hind-quarters of four-legged scurry member, Titan Edward, can be seen in this photo from that excursion.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the south side of the lake – visible in the background of the photo above – the trail runs parallel to a road that leads to a brush pile where Tama residents can dump tree limbs, brush and leaves collected from their yard. There’s been a LOT of that lately! On this occasion a friend of our, Charlie Betz, was hauling a pickup-load of derecho debris to the brush pile and stopped briefly to chat. Charlie suggested that someday soon he would return with his chainsaw to begin clearing deadfall from the trail. We told him to let us know when, and we’d see if we could come help. Well, that “when” was 7 AM the next day, Saturday, August 22.\n\nI arrived at the lake at 7 AM on the 22nd and found Charlie already there, preparing to fire up his saw. I brought my little 10' Ryobi cordless electric chainsaw and two fully-charged batteries. Jeff Shaw arrived about 20 minutes later and we proceeded to work our way counter-clockwise around the lake trail startring from the parking area on the east end of the lake. It was slow going, especially at first since the north side of the lake is, or was, densely wooded with some mature trees.\n\nAfter three hours of cutting and tossing debris to the side of the trail, we reached my family’s memorial bench at the west end of the lake.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy this time we had waded through way too much PI, been briefly rained on, dulled Charlie’s chainsaw blade, and drained both of the saw batteries I had on hand. I think we were drained too. Time for a break, so at 10 AM we departed for some rest, lunch, fresh batteries, and hopefully a new chain for Charlie’s saw. We reconvened at Noon, as planned, and spent the next two hours clearing the deadfall around the McFate bench, plus a pair of gnarly monsters that had fallen across the trail near the southeast corner of the lake.\n\nIt felt really good to get it all done, and now we can engage in our “scurry” walks around the lake without all the bobbing and weaving required to navigate the obstacle course that was. Every good volunteer effort should conclude with a photo or two, so we got all cleaned up, NOT, and I shot this one.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s a warp. Until next time… but only after I’ve had a pleasant scurry walk in the morning.\n\n",

So we have now been more than 10.5 days without power. I’m only able to post this because of a portable generator I bought on August 12 (that was an adventure in itself) and the wireless hotspot that my phone has provided almost 24/7 ever since the storm hit.</p><p>Update: Power was finally restored here at about 6:30 PM, on Thursday, August 20, 2020.  Now I just have 11.5 days of things to catch up on!</p><h2 id='preamble'>Preamble</h2><p>The preamble to this story dates back to Christmas 2019, when my daughter gave me a “Dad’s Love…” daily calendar. There have been a couple of dates I kept because they are so accurate, like the day that says “We child-proofed the house but somehow they still got in.”  😄  Tama County has been in the grips of a moderate-to-severe drought for the past couple of months so the calendar page for August 10 looked like another “keeper”. It says:</p><p><figure><img alt='Monday, August 10, &amp;ldquo;Dad&amp;rsquo;s Love&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Calendar' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Photo-2020-08-18-09-54.jpg'/><figcaption>Monday, August 10, 'Dad's Love...' Calendar</figcaption></figure></p><h2 id='930-am---scurry-walk'>9:30 AM - Scurry Walk</h2><p>This story begins in earnest around 9:30 AM on Monday, August 10, 2020.  My “scurry” and I were just completing a quick walk around Cherry Lake where we had picked up a little trash, as we usually do. We met a couple of neighbors out for a walk and chatted briefly about the weather, and I suggested that the line of storms now in western Iowa looked like they might just hold together. Every weather system thus far in the summer had passed either just to our north, just to the south, or formed just to the east, so the neighbors just scoffed at the notion of us getting any rain. I was so sure it would rain this time that I didn’t hesitate to put a concrete block on the west-half of my hot tub cover to keep it closed in case of wind. I guess I should have used all eight blocks this time?  😕</p><h2 id='1145-am---the-wind'>11:45 AM - The Wind</h2><p>The storms did indeed “hold together”.  Oh boy, did they ever.  A wall of wind hit Tama-Toledo at about 11:45 AM that morning, with literally NO warning from the US Weather Service. I had received alerts from the WeatherBug app on my iPhone, but there was no “official” word of impending doom.  The rain didn’t begin until 5 or 10 minutes later, and I’m not sure any hit the ground because EVERYTHING, tree limbs, mailboxes, small animals, etc., was moving sideways. The power went out moments later. It’s still out as of this writing, a little more than 10 days since.</p><h2 id='1155-am---get-the-cats'>11:55 AM - Get the Cats!</h2><p>After hustling to the basement and realizing the house was not gone, yet, we thought we’d better go back upstairs to get some candles, more flashlights, and our three cats.  Mackenzie and I managed to get two of the cats pretty easily, but the third one was stubborn and had to be “captured”.  While we were doing this I glanced out the window and saw nothing but tree limbs, still sailing past the windows on a nearly horizontal trajectory.</p><p>By the time we captured the last cat I thought to myself, the wind can’t last much longer…it had been blowing for at least 5 minutes straight, and I do mean STRAIGHT. I was very wrong.  Thinking back, I do believe the wind blew at upwards of 100 MPH or more for at least 20 minutes.</p><h2 id='1158-am---morgans-story'>11:58 AM - Morgan’s Story</h2><p>My daughter, Morgan, had been at the STC Middle School in Toledo working on getting her classroom ready for the start of school. She got a call from a friend in Des Moines at about 11:30 AM telling her to watch out for a line of t-storms heading her way. There are no windows in her classroom so when she finally left the Middle School and saw how dark the sky was she got really concerned and promptly ordered the building secretary to open the office and get a handful of students back inside.  They had just dismissed from summer-school and were waiting outside for their parents to pick them up.  Good thing she did that.</p><p>Morgan drove away from the Middle School just minutes before a wall-of-wind roared in, and she called my cell phone at 11:50 AM just as she passed our house, letting me know that she was going straight to her apartment because her landlord wasn’t home and she was worried about her cats. The 5-minute drive to her apartment took about 3 hours?  A couple of minutes later, at 11:55 AM we ran to our basement (after a 2nd mailbox went sailing past our front door) and Morgan called again at 11:58 AM. Her car had been hit by a falling tree limb, about 6' in diameter, near the crest of the hill on State Street in Tama, just south of the Tama Park. Her windshield was shattered, fortunately on the passenger’s side, and she was freaking out. I told her to stay in her car and Christine called 9-1-1 to provide her with some emergency aid.</p><p>The 9-1-1 call had to route through Benton county (30 miles east of us) as the local center was already overwhelmed, and the storm hadn’t hit there yet. A local police officer was dispatched and could get no closer than about 2.5 blocks from Morgan’s car due to downed trees, but made his way to her on-foot. He told her same as me, stay in your car to avoid downed power lines and potentially being hit by flying debris. He also told her to fasten her seatbelt in case the wind flipped the car over. Yikes!  That happened at 12:18 PM, and the wind was still fierce!</p><p>At 12:20 PM my wife realized where Morgan was and called a friend who lives at the location of Morgan’s “tree incident”, and that friend managed to summon her inside once it was safe to make a run for it.</p><h2 id='1230-pm---the-wind-finally-stopped-time-to-rescue-morgan'>12:30 PM - The Wind Finally Stopped, Time to “Rescue” Morgan</h2><p>It was about 12:30 PM when I felt like it was finally safe to go back upstairs and outside. Our mission was to try and get to Morgan as soon as possible.  The power was out so I could not easily raise our double garage door, so I peeked out the front door to see what the situation was. OMG!</p><p>Our house is about 70 years old and it is (was) surrounded by five very large, mature trees… two grand old Oaks flanking the front yard, an American Sycamore directly west of our garage and patio, and two very tall pines on the NW and NE corners of the house, plus a few smaller and younger trees and bushes. Our driveway measures about 15’ x 45’ and it was entirely covered in limbs from one of the oaks and the Sycamore. Some of the limbs down on the driveway measured more than 10' in diameter.  It ultimately took about 14 hours of back-breaking effort just to clear the driveway well enough for us to get both vehicles out of the garage.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of the storm I had two other transportation options: the bicycle I had just purchased on Saturday, August 8; or my daughter Mackenzie’s car which was parked at the curb west of our house. I was pretty sure that car, parked partly beneath one of the oaks and the Sycamore, would be badly damaged, but it was not. There were limbs and whole trees, from our neighbor to the west, lying all around it, but the car was unscathed and operable.  It took a little serpentine driving to navigate out of it’s parking spot, but by about 12:45 PM Christine and I were able to get it out and on-the road to try and “rescue” Morgan, roughly 1/2-mile away.</p><p>That 1/2-mile trip featured five impassable streets and a mile or two of back-tracking to find a suitable (barely) route.  The four-lane US Highway 63 proved to be the best route for most of the trip only because it was wide enough that trees on the west side generally didn’t block all four lanes. We arrived in the vicinity of Morgan’s car at 1:02 PM and found that she had already pulled the largest limb off her car, what was left looked like this:</p><p><figure><img alt='Morgan&amp;rsquo;s Damaged Nissan Rogue - A Total Loss' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/IMG_2053.jpeg'/><figcaption>Morgan's Damaged Nissan Rogue - A Total Loss</figcaption></figure></p><p>Morgan’s apartment is about 1-mile from the location where we left her car, and she knew that her landlord and family were away in Cedar Rapids for the day, so we headed there to check on that property, and her cats. That trip took about 10 minutes with numerous “detours” but I was able to drive to within a half-block of the house.  Thankfully we found the house intact with no visible, major damage, and the cats were safe, but obviously frightened, still inside Morgan’s apartment. Fortunately, the large old tree outside Morgan’s apartment window was damaged earlier this year in a storm, and had to be taken down entirely just a couple of weeks ago; otherwise it would have certainly damaged the house and her apartment. We called the landlord to report the relatively good news as they tried to begin their journey back home from CR. Then it started to rain again, just a little.</p><h2 id='the-damage'>The Damage</h2><p>This part of the story is perhaps best told in pictures.

It’s the gray thing that looks like a big old boulder on wheels in the right side of the first image below.  It survived, almost unscathed! The only damage was from the door being blown open.  That door hit the west wall of the house so hard that it bent a 1/8' thick steel latch plate back at a 120° angle. Because the door was open, things just inside the door also got a little wet, but they dried out well since then.  The whole camper pitched forward about 3’ in the wind, but the on-board drop-foot was down so it didn’t fall to the ground. Had any large limbs fallen directly on it, we’d have had a total loss of structure and contents.</p><p><figure><img alt='30 Looking SE from the NW Corner of Our Property' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Derecho%20-%2030.png'/><figcaption>Looking SE from the NW Corner of Our Property</figcaption></figure></p><p>Next, the hot tub and grill. The very first thing I did when I got outdoors after the storm was to flip the hot tub cover back down.  I have yet to clean all the leaves and debris out of the water…maybe later today.</p><p>When I receive any alert of a possible storm I always move one of the concrete blocks, seen stacked on the right in the image below, over to the west edge of my hot tub cover in order to keep it from blowing open.  I made that move about 15 minutes before the storm hit, but it didn’t help. In fact, it did more damage, I think.  The cover seems to be OK, but the wind did flip it open, sending the concrete block sailing about 10’ into the side of the house and narrowly missing the bathroom window that you can see. Lucky for us!</p><p>But our gas grill was not so lucky. That concrete block smashed down upon it leaving a big dent in the top, and causing the grill to “list” about 2' to port (the left side when looking from back to front).</p><p><figure><img alt='31 Looking at the Hot Tub and Limbs on the Roof' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Derecho%20-%2031.png'/><figcaption>Looking at the Hot Tub and Limbs on the Roof</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='45 The Grill' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/IMG_3531.png'/><figcaption>Our 1-Year-Old Gas Grill</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='27 Looking South from NW Corner of Our Property' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Derecho%20-%2027.png'/><figcaption>Looking South from NW Corner of Our Property</figcaption></figure></p><p>Finally, the limbs on the roof; you can see them clearly in some of these images. There were actually three of them, the largest with a diameter of about 5' at its base.  All three were from the Sycamore tree, which I suppose is lucky.  Sycamore’s have ENORMOUS leaves and while I feared severe damage to the roof, it looks like all three limbs just gently “floated” down to where I found them. I got them sawed up, and down off the roof, including an informal damage inspection plus wasp nest encounter, on Tuesday, August 11.</p><p><figure><img alt='28 Looking SE from the NW Corner of Our Property' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Derecho%20-%2028.png'/><figcaption>Looking SE from the NW Corner of Our Property</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='29 Looking East from the NW Corner of Our Property' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Derecho%20-%2029.png'/><figcaption>Looking East from the NW Corner of Our Property</figcaption></figure></p><h2 id='the-cleanup'>The Cleanup</h2><h3 id='building-the-worlds-largest--boma'>Building the World’s Largest (?)

Emergency Management office, called a public meeting, conducted in the parking lot of the nearby Tama-Toledo Family Aquatic Center, for 6 PM on Wednesday, August 12. At that meeting the cities informed everyone that any debris left at the curb would eventually be picked up and disposed of by a city crew. So, we started building what I like to think of as the world’s largest <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boma_(enclosure)'>boma</a>.</p><p>In the images below you can see both our west and south bomas.  We didn’t need any on the east or north since we have neighbors on those sides, but we did build a small boma (about 30’ long by 10’ wide) in the parking lot of the church that sits at the NE corner of our property, where our utilities pole is located.</p><p><figure><img alt='2 The West Boma - Panoramic' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Derecho%20-%202.png'/><figcaption>The West Boma - Panoramic</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='14 The South Boma - Panoramic' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Derecho%20-%2014.png'/><figcaption>The South Boma - Panoramic</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='6 The West Boma - Close-up' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Derecho%20-%206.png'/><figcaption>The West Boma - Close-up</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='10 The South Boma - Close-up' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Derecho%20-%2010.png'/><figcaption>The South Boma - Close-up</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='15 The South Boma - Close-up Looking West' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Derecho%20-%2015.png'/><figcaption>The South Boma - Close-up Looking West</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='44 SE Corner of the Property Looking at the Start of the South Boma' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Derecho%20-%2044.png'/><figcaption>SE Corner of the Property Looking at the Start of the South Boma</figcaption></figure></p><h3 id='the-tree-wrangler'>The Tree Wrangler</h3><p>On Thursday, August 13, I started to address some of the potential widow-makers still hanging in our trees.

Frustrations at home certainly weren’t getting any better so I felt like getting away to take a deep breath and realign my perspective a little.  Oak Hill usually does that for me.</p><p>Oak Hill Cemetery is well-named…it blankets the hill with Ian and my parents’ graves near the very top, and there are lots of oaks, but even more pines. Well, there used to be anyway.</p><p>This is perhaps another case where photos tell the story better than I.  However, I’m not sure the few photos I took will reflect the scale of the devastation. For starters, the main road up to the cemetery is still blocked, as are the three entrances into the original cemetery. Fortunately, the newest section where there are no mature trees, was relatively clear. So, Morgan and I were able to drive in and park about 100 yards from the hilltop.</p><p>This is a glimpse of what we found there…</p><p><figure><img alt='Oak Hill Cemetery from Near the Hilltop Looking South' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Photo-2020-08-20-19-41.jpeg'/><figcaption>Oak Hill Cemetery from Our Parked Car, Looking South</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='180 Degree Panorama' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Photo-2020-08-20-19-43.jpeg'/><figcaption>Oak Hill Cemetery - 180 Degree Panorama</figcaption></figure></p><p>I could not bear to shoot the panorama over the opposing 180° view…it was just too sad. 😢</p><p><figure><img alt='The Big Pine Near the McFate Plots' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Photo-2020-08-20-19-49.jpeg'/><figcaption>The Big Pine Near the McFate Plots</figcaption></figure></p><p>The broken pine, shown above, is, or was, near my parents’ graves, and you can see their shared headstone just to the right in the image above.  My son, Ian, is buried a little to the left of the edge of the image, but you can’t see that grave from this angle because of all the tree debris. <a href='https://coord.info/GC4BG3B'>“Ian’s Cache”, GC4BG3B</a> is somewhere inside or under that tree. I looked for the container for about 15 minutes this morning, but came up empty-handed. 😦</p><p>Fortunately, when the ol’ tree fell it missed Ian’s grave by a few feet. We got lucky and found all four of the clear acrylic cylinders that used to adorn his grave. They are all intact, but need a little TLC before we put them all back out.</p><p>My parents’ headstone is in good shape, but another tree toppled the nearby stone marker for my aunt, Dorothy Paddleford. I’ll see to it that gets fixed soon.</p><p>A few weeks ago my brother-in-law, Dennis, set in-motion a plan to install an engraved stone bench as a memorial for my sister, Marlene McFate Burkheimer. It was to be placed not far from the cemetery road at the very top of the hill, about 50’ from the big pine.  At one time we thought about looking into wrapping a bench around that ol’ pine to provide a nice place, in the shade, to sit and relax. However, providing a concrete base for such a bench would have been very difficult. Maybe if the pine’s stump is removed we can place the bench where the tree was, and maybe one day plant another tree to provide the shady spot we hoped for?</p><p><figure><img alt='Another View to the South from Ian&amp;rsquo;s Grave - The Road is Still Impassable' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Photo-2020-08-20-19-51.jpeg'/><figcaption>Another View to the South from Ian's Grave - The Road is Still Impassable</figcaption></figure></p><p>Tomorrow morning I plan to contact the City of Tama and the Oak Hill Cemetery Association to see about volunteering to help with clean-up.

So we have now been more than 10.5 days without power. I’m only able to post this because of a portable generator I bought on August 12 (that was an adventure in itself) and the wireless hotspot that my phone has provided almost 24/7 ever since the storm hit.</p><p>Update: Power was finally restored here at about 6:30 PM, on Thursday, August 20, 2020.  Now I just have 11.5 days of things to catch up on!</p><h2 id='preamble'>Preamble</h2><p>The preamble to this story dates back to Christmas 2019, when my daughter gave me a “Dad’s Love…” daily calendar. There have been a couple of dates I kept because they are so accurate, like the day that says “We child-proofed the house but somehow they still got in.”  😄  Tama County has been in the grips of a moderate-to-severe drought for the past couple of months so the calendar page for August 10 looked like another “keeper”. It says:</p><p><figure><img alt='Monday, August 10, &amp;ldquo;Dad&amp;rsquo;s Love&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Calendar' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Photo-2020-08-18-09-54.jpg'/><figcaption>Monday, August 10, 'Dad's Love...' Calendar</figcaption></figure></p><h2 id='930-am---scurry-walk'>9:30 AM - Scurry Walk</h2><p>This story begins in earnest around 9:30 AM on Monday, August 10, 2020.  My “scurry” and I were just completing a quick walk around Cherry Lake where we had picked up a little trash, as we usually do. We met a couple of neighbors out for a walk and chatted briefly about the weather, and I suggested that the line of storms now in western Iowa looked like they might just hold together. Every weather system thus far in the summer had passed either just to our north, just to the south, or formed just to the east, so the neighbors just scoffed at the notion of us getting any rain. I was so sure it would rain this time that I didn’t hesitate to put a concrete block on the west-half of my hot tub cover to keep it closed in case of wind. I guess I should have used all eight blocks this time?  😕</p><h2 id='1145-am---the-wind'>11:45 AM - The Wind</h2><p>The storms did indeed “hold together”.  Oh boy, did they ever.  A wall of wind hit Tama-Toledo at about 11:45 AM that morning, with literally NO warning from the US Weather Service. I had received alerts from the WeatherBug app on my iPhone, but there was no “official” word of impending doom.  The rain didn’t begin until 5 or 10 minutes later, and I’m not sure any hit the ground because EVERYTHING, tree limbs, mailboxes, small animals, etc., was moving sideways. The power went out moments later. It’s still out as of this writing, a little more than 10 days since.</p><h2 id='1155-am---get-the-cats'>11:55 AM - Get the Cats!</h2><p>After hustling to the basement and realizing the house was not gone, yet, we thought we’d better go back upstairs to get some candles, more flashlights, and our three cats.  Mackenzie and I managed to get two of the cats pretty easily, but the third one was stubborn and had to be “captured”.  While we were doing this I glanced out the window and saw nothing but tree limbs, still sailing past the windows on a nearly horizontal trajectory.</p><p>By the time we captured the last cat I thought to myself, the wind can’t last much longer…it had been blowing for at least 5 minutes straight, and I do mean STRAIGHT. I was very wrong.  Thinking back, I do believe the wind blew at upwards of 100 MPH or more for at least 20 minutes.</p><h2 id='1158-am---morgans-story'>11:58 AM - Morgan’s Story</h2><p>My daughter, Morgan, had been at the STC Middle School in Toledo working on getting her classroom ready for the start of school. She got a call from a friend in Des Moines at about 11:30 AM telling her to watch out for a line of t-storms heading her way. There are no windows in her classroom so when she finally left the Middle School and saw how dark the sky was she got really concerned and promptly ordered the building secretary to open the office and get a handful of students back inside.  They had just dismissed from summer-school and were waiting outside for their parents to pick them up.  Good thing she did that.</p><p>Morgan drove away from the Middle School just minutes before a wall-of-wind roared in, and she called my cell phone at 11:50 AM just as she passed our house, letting me know that she was going straight to her apartment because her landlord wasn’t home and she was worried about her cats. The 5-minute drive to her apartment took about 3 hours?  A couple of minutes later, at 11:55 AM we ran to our basement (after a 2nd mailbox went sailing past our front door) and Morgan called again at 11:58 AM. Her car had been hit by a falling tree limb, about 6' in diameter, near the crest of the hill on State Street in Tama, just south of the Tama Park. Her windshield was shattered, fortunately on the passenger’s side, and she was freaking out. I told her to stay in her car and Christine called 9-1-1 to provide her with some emergency aid.</p><p>The 9-1-1 call had to route through Benton county (30 miles east of us) as the local center was already overwhelmed, and the storm hadn’t hit there yet. A local police officer was dispatched and could get no closer than about 2.5 blocks from Morgan’s car due to downed trees, but made his way to her on-foot. He told her same as me, stay in your car to avoid downed power lines and potentially being hit by flying debris. He also told her to fasten her seatbelt in case the wind flipped the car over. Yikes!  That happened at 12:18 PM, and the wind was still fierce!</p><p>At 12:20 PM my wife realized where Morgan was and called a friend who lives at the location of Morgan’s “tree incident”, and that friend managed to summon her inside once it was safe to make a run for it.</p><h2 id='1230-pm---the-wind-finally-stopped-time-to-rescue-morgan'>12:30 PM - The Wind Finally Stopped, Time to “Rescue” Morgan</h2><p>It was about 12:30 PM when I felt like it was finally safe to go back upstairs and outside. Our mission was to try and get to Morgan as soon as possible.  The power was out so I could not easily raise our double garage door, so I peeked out the front door to see what the situation was. OMG!</p><p>Our house is about 70 years old and it is (was) surrounded by five very large, mature trees… two grand old Oaks flanking the front yard, an American Sycamore directly west of our garage and patio, and two very tall pines on the NW and NE corners of the house, plus a few smaller and younger trees and bushes. Our driveway measures about 15’ x 45’ and it was entirely covered in limbs from one of the oaks and the Sycamore. Some of the limbs down on the driveway measured more than 10' in diameter.  It ultimately took about 14 hours of back-breaking effort just to clear the driveway well enough for us to get both vehicles out of the garage.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of the storm I had two other transportation options: the bicycle I had just purchased on Saturday, August 8; or my daughter Mackenzie’s car which was parked at the curb west of our house. I was pretty sure that car, parked partly beneath one of the oaks and the Sycamore, would be badly damaged, but it was not. There were limbs and whole trees, from our neighbor to the west, lying all around it, but the car was unscathed and operable.  It took a little serpentine driving to navigate out of it’s parking spot, but by about 12:45 PM Christine and I were able to get it out and on-the road to try and “rescue” Morgan, roughly 1/2-mile away.</p><p>That 1/2-mile trip featured five impassable streets and a mile or two of back-tracking to find a suitable (barely) route.  The four-lane US Highway 63 proved to be the best route for most of the trip only because it was wide enough that trees on the west side generally didn’t block all four lanes. We arrived in the vicinity of Morgan’s car at 1:02 PM and found that she had already pulled the largest limb off her car, what was left looked like this:</p><p><figure><img alt='Morgan&amp;rsquo;s Damaged Nissan Rogue - A Total Loss' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/IMG_2053.jpeg'/><figcaption>Morgan's Damaged Nissan Rogue - A Total Loss</figcaption></figure></p><p>Morgan’s apartment is about 1-mile from the location where we left her car, and she knew that her landlord and family were away in Cedar Rapids for the day, so we headed there to check on that property, and her cats. That trip took about 10 minutes with numerous “detours” but I was able to drive to within a half-block of the house.  Thankfully we found the house intact with no visible, major damage, and the cats were safe, but obviously frightened, still inside Morgan’s apartment. Fortunately, the large old tree outside Morgan’s apartment window was damaged earlier this year in a storm, and had to be taken down entirely just a couple of weeks ago; otherwise it would have certainly damaged the house and her apartment. We called the landlord to report the relatively good news as they tried to begin their journey back home from CR. Then it started to rain again, just a little.</p><h2 id='the-damage'>The Damage</h2><p>This part of the story is perhaps best told in pictures.

It’s the gray thing that looks like a big old boulder on wheels in the right side of the first image below.  It survived, almost unscathed! The only damage was from the door being blown open.  That door hit the west wall of the house so hard that it bent a 1/8' thick steel latch plate back at a 120° angle. Because the door was open, things just inside the door also got a little wet, but they dried out well since then.  The whole camper pitched forward about 3’ in the wind, but the on-board drop-foot was down so it didn’t fall to the ground. Had any large limbs fallen directly on it, we’d have had a total loss of structure and contents.</p><p><figure><img alt='30 Looking SE from the NW Corner of Our Property' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Derecho%20-%2030.png'/><figcaption>Looking SE from the NW Corner of Our Property</figcaption></figure></p><p>Next, the hot tub and grill. The very first thing I did when I got outdoors after the storm was to flip the hot tub cover back down.  I have yet to clean all the leaves and debris out of the water…maybe later today.</p><p>When I receive any alert of a possible storm I always move one of the concrete blocks, seen stacked on the right in the image below, over to the west edge of my hot tub cover in order to keep it from blowing open.  I made that move about 15 minutes before the storm hit, but it didn’t help. In fact, it did more damage, I think.  The cover seems to be OK, but the wind did flip it open, sending the concrete block sailing about 10’ into the side of the house and narrowly missing the bathroom window that you can see. Lucky for us!</p><p>But our gas grill was not so lucky. That concrete block smashed down upon it leaving a big dent in the top, and causing the grill to “list” about 2' to port (the left side when looking from back to front).</p><p><figure><img alt='31 Looking at the Hot Tub and Limbs on the Roof' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Derecho%20-%2031.png'/><figcaption>Looking at the Hot Tub and Limbs on the Roof</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='45 The Grill' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/IMG_3531.png'/><figcaption>Our 1-Year-Old Gas Grill</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='27 Looking South from NW Corner of Our Property' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Derecho%20-%2027.png'/><figcaption>Looking South from NW Corner of Our Property</figcaption></figure></p><p>Finally, the limbs on the roof; you can see them clearly in some of these images. There were actually three of them, the largest with a diameter of about 5' at its base.  All three were from the Sycamore tree, which I suppose is lucky.  Sycamore’s have ENORMOUS leaves and while I feared severe damage to the roof, it looks like all three limbs just gently “floated” down to where I found them. I got them sawed up, and down off the roof, including an informal damage inspection plus wasp nest encounter, on Tuesday, August 11.</p><p><figure><img alt='28 Looking SE from the NW Corner of Our Property' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Derecho%20-%2028.png'/><figcaption>Looking SE from the NW Corner of Our Property</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='29 Looking East from the NW Corner of Our Property' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Derecho%20-%2029.png'/><figcaption>Looking East from the NW Corner of Our Property</figcaption></figure></p><h2 id='the-cleanup'>The Cleanup</h2><h3 id='building-the-worlds-largest--boma'>Building the World’s Largest (?)

At one time we thought about looking into wrapping a bench around that ol’ pine to provide a nice place, in the shade, to sit and relax. However, providing a concrete base for such a bench would have been very difficult. Maybe if the pine’s stump is removed we can place the bench where the tree was, and maybe one day plant another tree to provide the shady spot we hoped for?</p><p><figure><img alt='Another View to the South from Ian&amp;rsquo;s Grave - The Road is Still Impassable' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Photo-2020-08-20-19-51.jpeg'/><figcaption>Another View to the South from Ian's Grave - The Road is Still Impassable</figcaption></figure></p><p>Tomorrow morning I plan to contact the City of Tama and the Oak Hill Cemetery Association to see about volunteering to help with clean-up.

            "plaintext": "It’s been far too long, again, since I posted to this blog, but this time I have a legitimate excuse: we’ve been without power or internet, or much of anything, since about 11:45 AM on Monday, August 10, 2020. So we have now been more than 10.5 days without power. I’m only able to post this because of a portable generator I bought on August 12 (that was an adventure in itself) and the wireless hotspot that my phone has provided almost 24/7 ever since the storm hit.\n\nUpdate: Power was finally restored here at about 6:30 PM, on Thursday, August 20, 2020. Now I just have 11.5 days of things to catch up on!\n\n\nPreamble\n\nThe preamble to this story dates back to Christmas 2019, when my daughter gave me a “Dad’s Love…” daily calendar. There have been a couple of dates I kept because they are so accurate, like the day that says “We child-proofed the house but somehow they still got in.” 😄 Tama County has been in the grips of a moderate-to-severe drought for the past couple of months so the calendar page for August 10 looked like another “keeper”. It says:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9:30 AM - Scurry Walk\n\nThis story begins in earnest around 9:30 AM on Monday, August 10, 2020. My “scurry” and I were just completing a quick walk around Cherry Lake where we had picked up a little trash, as we usually do. We met a couple of neighbors out for a walk and chatted briefly about the weather, and I suggested that the line of storms now in western Iowa looked like they might just hold together. Every weather system thus far in the summer had passed either just to our north, just to the south, or formed just to the east, so the neighbors just scoffed at the notion of us getting any rain. I was so sure it would rain this time that I didn’t hesitate to put a concrete block on the west-half of my hot tub cover to keep it closed in case of wind. I guess I should have used all eight blocks this time? 😕\n\n\n11:45 AM - The Wind\n\nThe storms did indeed “hold together”. Oh boy, did they ever. A wall of wind hit Tama-Toledo at about 11:45 AM that morning, with literally NO warning from the US Weather Service. I had received alerts from the WeatherBug app on my iPhone, but there was no “official” word of impending doom. The rain didn’t begin until 5 or 10 minutes later, and I’m not sure any hit the ground because EVERYTHING, tree limbs, mailboxes, small animals, etc., was moving sideways. The power went out moments later. It’s still out as of this writing, a little more than 10 days since.\n\n\n11:55 AM - Get the Cats!\n\nAfter hustling to the basement and realizing the house was not gone, yet, we thought we’d better go back upstairs to get some candles, more flashlights, and our three cats. Mackenzie and I managed to get two of the cats pretty easily, but the third one was stubborn and had to be “captured”. While we were doing this I glanced out the window and saw nothing but tree limbs, still sailing past the windows on a nearly horizontal trajectory.\n\nBy the time we captured the last cat I thought to myself, the wind can’t last much longer…it had been blowing for at least 5 minutes straight, and I do mean STRAIGHT. I was very wrong. Thinking back, I do believe the wind blew at upwards of 100 MPH or more for at least 20 minutes.\n\n\n11:58 AM - Morgan’s Story\n\nMy daughter, Morgan, had been at the STC Middle School in Toledo working on getting her classroom ready for the start of school. She got a call from a friend in Des Moines at about 11:30 AM telling her to watch out for a line of t-storms heading her way. There are no windows in her classroom so when she finally left the Middle School and saw how dark the sky was she got really concerned and promptly ordered the building secretary to open the office and get a handful of students back inside. They had just dismissed from summer-school and were waiting outside for their parents to pick them up. Good thing she did that.\n\nMorgan drove away from the Middle School just minutes before a wall-of-wind roared in, and she called my cell phone at 11:50 AM just as she passed our house, letting me know that she was going straight to her apartment because her landlord wasn’t home and she was worried about her cats. The 5-minute drive to her apartment took about 3 hours? A couple of minutes later, at 11:55 AM we ran to our basement (after a 2nd mailbox went sailing past our front door) and Morgan called again at 11:58 AM. Her car had been hit by a falling tree limb, about 6' in diameter, near the crest of the hill on State Street in Tama, just south of the Tama Park. Her windshield was shattered, fortunately on the passenger’s side, and she was freaking out. I told her to stay in her car and Christine called 9-1-1 to provide her with some emergency aid.\n\nThe 9-1-1 call had to route through Benton county (30 miles east of us) as the local center was already overwhelmed, and the storm hadn’t hit there yet. A local police officer was dispatched and could get no closer than about 2.5 blocks from Morgan’s car due to downed trees, but made his way to her on-foot. He told her same as me, stay in your car to avoid downed power lines and potentially being hit by flying debris. He also told her to fasten her seatbelt in case the wind flipped the car over. Yikes! That happened at 12:18 PM, and the wind was still fierce!\n\nAt 12:20 PM my wife realized where Morgan was and called a friend who lives at the location of Morgan’s “tree incident”, and that friend managed to summon her inside once it was safe to make a run for it.\n\n\n12:30 PM - The Wind Finally Stopped, Time to “Rescue” Morgan\n\nIt was about 12:30 PM when I felt like it was finally safe to go back upstairs and outside. Our mission was to try and get to Morgan as soon as possible. The power was out so I could not easily raise our double garage door, so I peeked out the front door to see what the situation was. OMG!\n\nOur house is about 70 years old and it is (was) surrounded by five very large, mature trees… two grand old Oaks flanking the front yard, an American Sycamore directly west of our garage and patio, and two very tall pines on the NW and NE corners of the house, plus a few smaller and younger trees and bushes. Our driveway measures about 15’ x 45’ and it was entirely covered in limbs from one of the oaks and the Sycamore. Some of the limbs down on the driveway measured more than 10' in diameter. It ultimately took about 14 hours of back-breaking effort just to clear the driveway well enough for us to get both vehicles out of the garage.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the storm I had two other transportation options: the bicycle I had just purchased on Saturday, August 8; or my daughter Mackenzie’s car which was parked at the curb west of our house. I was pretty sure that car, parked partly beneath one of the oaks and the Sycamore, would be badly damaged, but it was not. There were limbs and whole trees, from our neighbor to the west, lying all around it, but the car was unscathed and operable. It took a little serpentine driving to navigate out of it’s parking spot, but by about 12:45 PM Christine and I were able to get it out and on-the road to try and “rescue” Morgan, roughly 1/2-mile away.\n\nThat 1/2-mile trip featured five impassable streets and a mile or two of back-tracking to find a suitable (barely) route. The four-lane US Highway 63 proved to be the best route for most of the trip only because it was wide enough that trees on the west side generally didn’t block all four lanes. We arrived in the vicinity of Morgan’s car at 1:02 PM and found that she had already pulled the largest limb off her car, what was left looked like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nMorgan’s apartment is about 1-mile from the location where we left her car, and she knew that her landlord and family were away in Cedar Rapids for the day, so we headed there to check on that property, and her cats. That trip took about 10 minutes with numerous “detours” but I was able to drive to within a half-block of the house. Thankfully we found the house intact with no visible, major damage, and the cats were safe, but obviously frightened, still inside Morgan’s apartment. Fortunately, the large old tree outside Morgan’s apartment window was damaged earlier this year in a storm, and had to be taken down entirely just a couple of weeks ago; otherwise it would have certainly damaged the house and her apartment. We called the landlord to report the relatively good news as they tried to begin their journey back home from CR. Then it started to rain again, just a little.\n\n\nThe Damage\n\nThis part of the story is perhaps best told in pictures. I took some photos and am posting them here in chronological order, with descriptive captions.\n\n\nFirst Glimpse Out the Window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeaded Outside to Shoot More Photos\n\nThe power was out everywhere for 30 to 50 miles all around us so we assumed it was safe to get outside and take some better photos. No chance of getting cars out of the garage… our driveway was at least 80% covered by tree parts, some places it was 4 feet deep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Side Story - The “Rolling Stone”, Hot Tub, Grill, and Limbs on the Roof\n\nThere were three pleasantly-amazing (lucky) things that happened, or didn’t happen as the case may be, on the west, windward, side of the house.\n\nFirst up, my home-made lightweight teardrop camper, “The Rolling Stone”. It’s the gray thing that looks like a big old boulder on wheels in the right side of the first image below. It survived, almost unscathed! The only damage was from the door being blown open. That door hit the west wall of the house so hard that it bent a 1/8' thick steel latch plate back at a 120° angle. Because the door was open, things just inside the door also got a little wet, but they dried out well since then. The whole camper pitched forward about 3’ in the wind, but the on-board drop-foot was down so it didn’t fall to the ground. Had any large limbs fallen directly on it, we’d have had a total loss of structure and contents.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, the hot tub and grill. The very first thing I did when I got outdoors after the storm was to flip the hot tub cover back down. I have yet to clean all the leaves and debris out of the water…maybe later today.\n\nWhen I receive any alert of a possible storm I always move one of the concrete blocks, seen stacked on the right in the image below, over to the west edge of my hot tub cover in order to keep it from blowing open. I made that move about 15 minutes before the storm hit, but it didn’t help. In fact, it did more damage, I think. The cover seems to be OK, but the wind did flip it open, sending the concrete block sailing about 10’ into the side of the house and narrowly missing the bathroom window that you can see. Lucky for us!\n\nBut our gas grill was not so lucky. That concrete block smashed down upon it leaving a big dent in the top, and causing the grill to “list” about 2' to port (the left side when looking from back to front).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the limbs on the roof; you can see them clearly in some of these images. There were actually three of them, the largest with a diameter of about 5' at its base. All three were from the Sycamore tree, which I suppose is lucky. Sycamore’s have ENORMOUS leaves and while I feared severe damage to the roof, it looks like all three limbs just gently “floated” down to where I found them. I got them sawed up, and down off the roof, including an informal damage inspection plus wasp nest encounter, on Tuesday, August 11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cleanup\n\n\nBuilding the World’s Largest (?) Boma\n\nThe mayors of Tama and Toledo, along with the Tama Co. Emergency Management office, called a public meeting, conducted in the parking lot of the nearby Tama-Toledo Family Aquatic Center, for 6 PM on Wednesday, August 12. At that meeting the cities informed everyone that any debris left at the curb would eventually be picked up and disposed of by a city crew. So, we started building what I like to think of as the world’s largest boma.\n\nIn the images below you can see both our west and south bomas. We didn’t need any on the east or north since we have neighbors on those sides, but we did build a small boma (about 30’ long by 10’ wide) in the parking lot of the church that sits at the NE corner of our property, where our utilities pole is located.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tree Wrangler\n\nOn Thursday, August 13, I started to address some of the potential widow-makers still hanging in our trees. My first target was the one shown below. I managed to rig a short chain to the end of a nylon rope and after about 10 tries I got the chain wrapped around the most menacing widow-maker, and yanked that sucker right out of the tree. They call me the “Tree Wrangler”. I’m pleased to report that subsequent limb-roping adventures took fewer tosses!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you remember seeing an ominous widow-maker in the Sycamore tree in earlier images? Well she is no more. At about 1:30 PM on Wednesday, August 19, I roped that critter and managed, with considerable effort, to yank that bad boy down. Proof that “The Tree Wrangler” has struck again…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Random Photos - Post Cleanup\n\nJust posting more random, post-cleanup photos here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs - Still World Champs\n\nAfter closing the hot tub cover I made sure to get out and untangle my KC Chiefs flag!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur $800 Savior\n\nOn Wednesday morning, August 12, I got word that some of the big-box hardware stores in Cedar Rapids and Waterloo were receiving shipments of portable generators. They were being sold on a first-come basis, right off the truck, so Morgan and I got in the van and headed to Waterloo as fast as possible…we got one at Lowe’s for $800. Had to wait in line for a couple of hours too, but managed to get home mid-afternoon with the generator, some ice and gasoline. None of those things would be available locally until Friday, August 14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Biggest Remaining Concern - Broken at the Base?\n\nMy biggest remaining worry is the pine tree at the NW corner of the house. On Thursday, August 13, during clean-up I discovered that the bark on the SE side of the tree is “crushed” as you can see in the image below, and there’s a visible “crack” on the NW side of the tree right at ground-level. Upon closer inspection it looks like the tree is leaning about 5°, naturally right toward our house. 😟\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouston, We Have a Problem OR The Eagle Has Landed!\n\nOne block west of our house there’s a bank, and it used to have a large golden-colored eagle atop it’s electronic sign at the intersection of Summit Street and US Highway 63. When we told folks from out-of-town how to find us we would always use that eagle as a navigational aid, telling them to find the eagle and head one block east to our house.\n\nWell, our navigational aid got its wings during the storm. As you can see in the photos below, the eagle “flew” about 200 feet and landed in the bank’s lawn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith No Apparent Structural Damage, We Were Luckier Than Some\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOak Hill Cemetery - August 20, 2020\n\nSince all the Alliant trucks rolled past our house around 10 AM this morning, I thought it was time to visit Ian and my parents at Oak Hill Cemetery. Frustrations at home certainly weren’t getting any better so I felt like getting away to take a deep breath and realign my perspective a little.

For starters, the main road up to the cemetery is still blocked, as are the three entrances into the original cemetery. Fortunately, the newest section where there are no mature trees, was relatively clear. So, Morgan and I were able to drive in and park about 100 yards from the hilltop.\n\nThis is a glimpse of what we found there…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI could not bear to shoot the panorama over the opposing 180° view…it was just too sad. 😢\n\n\n\n\n\nThe broken pine, shown above, is, or was, near my parents’ graves, and you can see their shared headstone just to the right in the image above. My son, Ian, is buried a little to the left of the edge of the image, but you can’t see that grave from this angle because of all the tree debris. “Ian’s Cache”, GC4BG3B is somewhere inside or under that tree. I looked for the container for about 15 minutes this morning, but came up empty-handed. 😦\n\nFortunately, when the ol’ tree fell it missed Ian’s grave by a few feet. We got lucky and found all four of the clear acrylic cylinders that used to adorn his grave. They are all intact, but need a little TLC before we put them all back out.\n\nMy parents’ headstone is in good shape, but another tree toppled the nearby stone marker for my aunt, Dorothy Paddleford. I’ll see to it that gets fixed soon.\n\nA few weeks ago my brother-in-law, Dennis, set in-motion a plan to install an engraved stone bench as a memorial for my sister, Marlene McFate Burkheimer. It was to be placed not far from the cemetery road at the very top of the hill, about 50’ from the big pine. At one time we thought about looking into wrapping a bench around that ol’ pine to provide a nice place, in the shade, to sit and relax. However, providing a concrete base for such a bench would have been very difficult. Maybe if the pine’s stump is removed we can place the bench where the tree was, and maybe one day plant another tree to provide the shady spot we hoped for?\n\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow morning I plan to contact the City of Tama and the Oak Hill Cemetery Association to see about volunteering to help with clean-up. I think they are going to want all the help they can get in the coming weeks and months.\n\n\nG’night\n\nIt’s late-evening again, but at least now I have some real lights to work by. Tomorrow I need to start reprogramming all the devices that have been dead for 11.5 days, and begin making up for as many days of missed work. Time for bed. G’night all.\n\nUntil next time… but I hope there’s never another “next time” quite like this one!\n\n",

            "plaintext": "Yesterday one of my library colleagues at Grinnell College posted an announcement that Atom would be retired (sunset) in December 2022. Ouch, I have a lot of workflows that depend on Atom!\n\nSo, today part of my mission is to begin the process of migrating workflows, both work-related and personal/at-home, from Atom to its most logical replacement, Visual Studio Code or VS Code as it’s largely known in the development community. The other part of today’s mission was to update this blog, something I’ve not done in far too long!\n\nWhat better time to begin using VS Code than right now, to edit this blog post? So, that’s what I did, er, am doing.\n\nThis could be a long story, but I’ll keep it short and just share the links, mostly. I’ll begin on my personal Mac Mini, where I’m editing now, so I can test the entire process before repeating it on my other Mac workstations.\n\n\nInstall Using Homebrew\n\nI like to use homebrew whenever possible to manage installations on my Mac. On this Mac Mini I found this Homebrew Formulae and put it to use… All done. Nice!\n\n\nAdding a Command Line / Terminal Shortcut\n\nI’ve gotten quite used to launching Atom in my working directory with a simple command of the form atom .. Can I do the same with VS Code? Sure! I used the guidance found in How to Open Visual Studio Code From Your Terminal to set that up. Piece of cake. I love finding timely, not stale, advice that just works!\n\nNow I can simply navigate to a project folder on my Mac and type code . to open it all in VS Code. Sweet!\n\n\nReplacing My Atom Packages\n\nThere are quite a few, nothing that I’ve written personally, but lots of published packages/extensions borrowed from others. That’s one of the things I love(d) about Atom. On my Mac Mini, and most other Macs, that list looks something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nI told you there were quite a few. I’m posting this image of my list just so I have a document as I begin to build the same into VS Code. Oh, when I added the above image to this post, I did so by dragging my screen-capture from my desktop directly into the VS Code EXPLORER panel (left side of my window), just like I used to do with Atom. Nice!\n\nI’ll take my time and start replacing these as-needed. First up…\n\n\nReplacing ISO 8601 timestamp\n\nThis Atom package allows me to add the current date and time, in ISO 8601 format, to the frontmatter of a blog post like the one you are reading now. I found and followed this documentation to set it up in VS Code. In Atom I put my cursor at the point where my timestamp was needed, and went to the Packages menu to insert it. In VS Code there doesn’t appear to be such a menu, but the documentation says I can use command-shift-P to open the “command pallette”, where I can scroll to or search for the command I want to engage. Another piece of cake!\n\nThe result of inserting the current timestamp should be reflected in the frontmatter of this blog post. 😀\n\n\nMore Goodies\n\nThis morning I updated this entry after adding a Duplicate file or directory command using the Duplicate Action extension from the marketplace. It works very nicely!\n\nWhat’s could be better? Well, finding a list of 10 “must-have” VSCode extensions and working my way through them!\n\n\nLuna Paint\n\nI just stumbled across another handy VSCode extension, Luna Paint. I’ve installed it, took all of 2 minutes to update TWO Macs, using the guidance provided in this YouTube video. It rocks! 2022-07-19T10:07:39-05:00\n\nWith any luck I’ll be able to use this post to perform much the same configuration on my other Macs, soon.

            "plaintext": "I recently returned from vacation in Norway with a few hundred photos and a handful of videos, taken mostly using my iPhone 8. I find that the Apple Photos app does a pretty nice job of cataloging photos and videos into Moments. Each Moment includes all the images taken in a single day, and sometimes in a particular location, if photos are taken on the same day, but a great distance apart.\n\nMoment names from my Norway vacation were nicely descriptive, like:\n\n * Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport - Minneapolis, MN, June 11, 2019\n * Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport - Mauregard, Île-de-France, June 12, 2019\n * Jessheim - Akershus, June 12, 2019\n * Kirkenes, Finnmark - Johan Knudtzens gate, June 12, 2019\n * Kirkenes, Finnmark - Dr. Wessels gate, June 13, 2019\n * Kirkenes, Finnmark - Johan Knudtzens gate, June 14, 2019\n * Skarsvåg - Finnmark, June 14, 2019\n * Arnøyhamn - Norway, June 15, 2019\n\n\nExporting the Photos\n\nI found this resource on the web and followed it for the export portion of my process.\n\nSo, I opened Photos on my Mac Mini, selected the Moments view/tab, culled some of the duplicates out, then selected all 359 remaining images using my mouse. With the images highlighted I selected menu options: File, Export, and Export 359 Photos.... I subsequently filled in the following dialog like so:\n\n\n\n\n\nI choose a ‘Photo Kind’, or format, equal to PNG and a ‘Size’ equal to Medium, since most of the images are huge and would load very slowly in my blog if left at their original size. I elected to save the exported PNG images into a new folder on my ~/Desktop named Norway-Medium-PNG-Export.\n\n\nUpload to Digital Ocean “Spaces”\n\nA few days ago I registered with Digital Ocean “Spaces”, and created my first “bucket” named images-summittdweller. Spaces provides me with up to 280 GB of REST-accessible object storage for a small monthly fee. To host my photos there I simply created a “folder” named Norway-Photos-2019 and did a drag-n-drop of each ~/Desktop/Norway-Medium-PNG-Export/ individual* folder directly into my browser window. *Note that the drag-n-drop interface was unable to swallow the entire Norway-Medium-PNG-Export folder all at once. 😞\n\nAll of my uploads to the images-summittdweller bucket were declared as Public rather than Private, that way they can be accessed using simple URLs without authentication.\n\n\nAdditional Images\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned photos, I also parked a copy of the PhotosExportDialog.png screen capture there in the root folder. It’s accessible as https://images.summittdweller.com/Norway-Photos-2019/PhotosExportDialog.png and that’s what I used above to embed the image you see in this document.\n\nIn the future, more images, perhaps some taken by Deb, Doug, or Mark McCune, can be added to this photo blog in a similar manner.\n\n\nObject Structure and URLs\n\nA sampling of the bucket/object/filenames and URLs from images-summittdweller are tabulated below. From this small sample the URL structure is easy to infer.\n\nimages-summittdweller Bucket PathURL./Norway-Photos-2019/PhotosExportDialog.pnghttps://images.summittdweller.com/Norway-Photos-2019/PhotosExportDialog.png./Norway-Photos-2019/Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport - Minneapolis, MN, June 11, 2019/IMG_0352.pnghttps://images.summittdweller.com/Norway-Photos-2019/Minneapolis-Saint%20Paul%20International%20Airport%20-%20Minneapolis,%20MN,%20June%2011,%202019/IMG_0352.png./Norway-Photos-2019/Tromsø - Troms, June 15, 2019/IMG_0527.pnghttps://images.summittdweller.com/Norway-Photos-2019/Troms%C3%B8%20-%20Troms,%20June%2015,%202019/IMG_0527.png\n\n\nGenerating Markdown for Blog Photos\n\nSo the intent of all this is to populate the photo blogs that you see here. To that end I’ve created a simple API Python3 script based on guidance provided in this article.\n\n",

So, it's time to move that front matter out of the `excerpt` and to the end of the content body.  \\n\\nUpdate: _Publisher for Ghost_ just isn't cutting it so I did a little research and am on the cusp of making a switch... to [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/), because it has a great little piece of _Ghost_ integration built-in.\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"Note that in the remainder of this article there are references to the delimiter I use to set my \\\"rear matter\\\" apart from other content.

Since my code pulls from `post.html` I found it necessary to first `split` the post, then remove any/all HTML tags from the \\\"rear matter\\\" portion before passing that into the _gray-matter_ package and the `matter` function for parsing.\\n\\nSo, the `dash-slash-dash` is used to split the `post.html` and the `slash-dash-slash` after it becomes the opening delimiter for the `matter` function.  Using `------` or anything beginning with `---` wasn't ideal because the Markdown editors I use frequently convert those into `<hr>` tags.\\n\\nAnother factor, I find the `-/` combination is easy to type on my iPhone because both characters appear on the same \\\"special characters\\\" keyboard, so I don't have to switch keyboard in between, and they are positioned side-by-side.  \"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"-/-/-/\\nlocation: Toledo, IA\\nexplanation: There's a reason why I choose an odd looking delimiter.

It worked nicely, but for whatever reason two of the images failed to upload: `Derecho - 38.png` and `Derecho - 39.png`.

That way I don't have to edit any of my posts in order to get the smaller web-ready images, but I won't lose the originals either.  **Beautimous**.\\n\\n## Belay That Order!\\nWhile I'm confident this approach (above) will work, it may not be necessary.

            "plaintext": "Earlier in this blog there's a micropost that lays out the problem at hand. In a nutshell, most of the photos I saved in DigitalOcean Spaces are too big to be effective in this blog. They suck up lots of time and bandwidth every time this blog gets rebuilt, and then they are rendered at a fraction of their original size. This is exceptionall wasteful and unnecessary.\n\n\nSo, my task this morning is to install, configure, and engage the s3cmd tools to help get this done. There's DigitalOcean-specific guidance provided in Setting Up s3cmd 2.x with DigitalOcean Spaces so that's where I will begin. Here goes...\n\n\n\nInstalling s3cmd\n\n\nThis looks to be very simple and straightforward, brew install s3cmd should do the trick. In a substantially abridged form, that looked like this:\n\n\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/blog-eleventy-ghost ‹main›\n╰─$ brew install s3cmd\nRunning `brew update --auto-update`...\n==> Auto-updated Homebrew!\n==> Updated Homebrew from 4.0.10 (931327df1) to 4.0.13 (ac0663ae5).\nUpdated 4 taps (dart-lang/dart, sass/sass, homebrew/core and homebrew/cask).\n...\nYou have 55 outdated formulae and 1 outdated cask installed.\n...\n==> Installing s3cmd\n==> Pouring s3cmd--2.3.0.ventura.bottle.1.tar.gz\n🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/s3cmd/2.3.0: 837 files, 11.4MB\n==> Running `brew cleanup s3cmd`...\nDisable this behaviour by setting HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP.\nHide these hints with HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_HINTS (see `man brew`).\n...\n\n\n\nThat took about 10 minutes, but should be worth it.\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nNext, to begin configuration I need to fetch the access key:value pair for images-summittdweller that I created 4 years ago. I have the credentials necessary to view that information at https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/spaces so that's what I've done.\n\n\nWhoa, that didn't work! I tried to use old access keys but apparently they are in the wrong format? So, I created a new key named key-for-s3cmd and applied that (see below) and it works.\n\n\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/blog-eleventy-ghost ‹main›\n╰─$ s3cmd --configure\n\nEnter new values or accept defaults in brackets with Enter.\nRefer to user manual for detailed description of all options.\n\nAccess key and Secret key are your identifiers for Amazon S3. Leave them empty for using the env variables.\nAccess Key [images-summittdweller]: ***This is a secret***\nSecret Key [4YPWYNXZZXFDIR6CRPHG]: ***An even bigger secret***\nDefault Region [US]:\n\nUse \"s3.amazonaws.com\" for S3 Endpoint and not modify it to the target Amazon S3.\nS3 Endpoint [nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com]:\n\nUse \"%(bucket)s.s3.amazonaws.com\" to the target Amazon S3. \"%(bucket)s\" and \"%(location)s\" vars can be used\nif the target S3 system supports dns based buckets.\nDNS-style bucket+hostname:port template for accessing a bucket [%(bucket)s.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com]:\n\nEncryption password is used to protect your files from reading\nby unauthorized persons while in transfer to S3\nEncryption password [SummittDweller]:\nPath to GPG program [__GHOST_URL__/usr/local/bin/gpg]:\n\nWhen using secure HTTPS protocol all communication with Amazon S3\nservers is protected from 3rd party eavesdropping.

Encryption and decryption worked fine :-)\n\nSave settings? [y/N] y\nConfiguration saved to '/Users/mark/.s3cfg'\n\n\n\n\nUsing s3cwd\n\n\nThe \"More Information\" section at the end of the document I used above says that... \"You can use our quick reference on s3cmd usage to get started.\" Ok, let's have a look... very nice! I'm moving immediately to the Save files to your local computer bits.\n\n\n\nFetching Files of the August 2020 Derecho\n\n\nThe photos I saved of damage from our August 2020 Derecho, in a images-summittdweller/2020-Aug-10-Derecho bucket, are rather depressing and certainly don't need to be super high-res for the web, so let's retrieve those and practice this workflow there first.\n\n\nThe quick reference linked above says to use a command of the form s3cmd get s3://spacename/path/ --recursive to get all files from a particular folder. In my case, that's...\n\n\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/Downloads/2020-derecho-photos\n╰─$ s3cmd get s3://images-summittdweller/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/ --recursive\n\nWARNING: Empty object name on S3 found, ignoring.\ndownload: 's3://images-summittdweller/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/Derecho - 1.png' -> './Derecho - 1.png'  [1 of 82]\n 23486944 of 23486944   100% in    1s    21.04 MB/s  done\ndownload: 's3://images-summittdweller/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/Derecho - 10.png' -> './Derecho - 10.png'  [2 of 82]\n 20861132 of 20861132   100% in    0s    23.45 MB/s  done\n...\ndownload: 's3://images-summittdweller/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/Photo-2020-08-20-19-51.jpeg' -> './Photo-2020-08-20-19-51.jpeg'  [81 of 82]\n 6277783 of 6277783   100% in    0s    16.86 MB/s  done\nERROR: Creation of file './for-the-web/' failed (Reason: Is a directory)\n\n\n\nOk, 81 images downloaded. That was sooooooooo much better than the 1000-or-so clicks it would have taken to do that manually! The only gottcha... that last error message about not downloading the for-the-web directory, which is currently empty anyway. Before I go farther, I'm going to open that DigitalOcean Spaces bucket and change the errant directory name to web-ready; that's where my \"thumbnail\" copies of all these images will be uploaded shortly.\n\n\n\nNext Step, Resize Those Images\n\n\nI found some concise and timely advice in the first web post I Googled: How to quickly resize multiple images at once on Mac. It uses exactly the tool I had in mind, the Mac-native Preview app.\n\n\nBefore begining that process I wanted to see just how much space my 81 images occupy, like so:\n\n\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/Downloads/2020-derecho-photos\n╰─$ du -sh\n2.7G\t.\n\n\n\n2.7G isn't all that much, but it's still much bigger than it needs to be.

Only took a couple of minutes and it reduced the total image size from 2.7G down to 163M. Not too shabby.\n\n\n\nUploads Complete... Next?\n\n\nIn order to upload the resized images back to DigitalOcean Spaces, I simply used the nice graphical interface available to me at https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces/images-summittdweller?path=2020-Aug-10-Derecho%2Fweb-ready and the Upload option there.

Makes sense. In my new web-ready directory the reduced-size copy of the same image naturally has an endpoint of https://images.summittdweller.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/web-ready/Derecho%20-%201.png. Fortunately, that's a \"match\" except for the addition of the web-ready subdirectory in the path. Exactly what I hoped would happen.\n\n\nThis means the next step is to...\n\n\n\nAlter Content to Include the web-ready Path\n\n\nI used the admin search (magnifying glass) feature of the Ghost instance behind this blog to find all references to https://images.summittdweller.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho and it found: NOTHING. Yikes. Turns out all of the references were in one post, and it was draft. So I edited the draft \"manually\" and published it. Now let's try that search again... NOPE.

That way I don't have to edit any of my posts in order to get the smaller web-ready images, but I won't lose the originals either. Beautimous.\n\n\n\nBelay That Order!\n\n\nWhile I'm confident this approach (above) will work, it may not be necessary.

I don't really understand the details of that difference, but it worked.\n\n\n\neleventy.after Never Fires?\n\n\nThe biggest hurdle for me was trying to get this bit of Robb's code to work.\n\n\nconst { execSync } = require('child_process')\n\nmodule.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {\n  eleventyConfig.on('eleventy.after', () => {\n    execSync(`npx pagefind --source _site --glob \\\"**/*.html\\\"`, { encoding: 'utf-8' })\n  })\n}\n\n\n\nIn my case the --source parameter needed to be dist since this blog is generated into a directory by that name, and my configuration object is simply config rather than eleventyConfig. I made those simple changes and added my snippet to the .eleventy.js file, but found that it never triggered. I even replaced the execSync function call with a simple console.log statement and still got nothing. And still to this day, I have no idea why that didn't work.\n\n\nThat snippet of code is supposed to be responsible for indexing all of the .html files after Eleventy has generated them. Well, I found out that everything else was working properly, but the _pagefind bundle generated by that indexing operation was just \"missing\", since the index never was created. That made me wonder what would happen if I \"forced\" the system to index my content in a different manner...and that wonder ultimately worked.\n\n\n\nUsing npx pagefind... to Index Content\n\n\nHaving studied some of the Pagefind documentation I wondered what adding some post-processing to my build workflow might do, something like npx pagefind --source dist? That ultimately worked, but not in that original form.\n\n\nI found that when I ran yarn start to locally rebuild the site, there was no generated ./dist/_pagefind bundle present, so I got no \"Search\" user interface elements, but there was an empty <div> where that belonged. So, with my localhost instance still running I opened a new terminal and ran npx pagefind --source dist in the project directory. Voila! The ./dist/_pagefind bundle magically appeared and the \"Search\" control was instantly visible in my localhost window! It was working, and it was beautiful.\n\n\n\nAdded a pagefind Script... Didn't Work\n\n\nOk, with the above breakthrough in-hand I made this addition to the scripts: key in my package.json file:\n\n\n  \"pagefind\": \"npx pagefind --source dist\"\n\n\n\nThen I added the following to the end of my steps: key in .github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml:\n\n\n  - run: yarn pagefind\n\n\n\nThis worked to some extent, but wasn't reliable and absolutely didn't work when deployed to my DigitalOcean app. The inner-workings of yarn and build caching in these environments is still a DEEP mystery to me!\n\n\n\nExtending My encrypt Script\n\n\nWhat does work, both locally and on DigitalOcean, is essentially an \"extension\" of my old encrypt script. My old build workflow included these two elements of package.json and build-and-deploy.yml:\n\n\n    \"encrypt\": \"staticrypt ./dist/rebuild.html '***hidden***' --short -o ./dist/rebuild.html -f ./src/auth/login.html -t 'Summitt Dweller Blog - Rebuild' -i 'Please enter the passphrase.<br/>Hint: gh0st' --label-error 'Sorry, Ella says no. Try again.'\"\n\n\n\n...and...\n\n\n  - run: yarn encrypt\n\n\n\nI took note of the relative path spec for ./dist/rebuild.html in the encrypt command, reasoned that I should run pagefind in a similar fashion -- but just before encryption -- and came up with this change in package.json:\n\n\n    \"encrypt\": \"npx pagefind --source ./dist && staticrypt ./dist/rebuild.html '***hidden***' --short -o ./dist/rebuild.html -f ./src/auth/login.html -t 'Summitt Dweller Blog - Rebuild' -i 'Please enter the passphrase.<br/>Hint: gh0st' --label-error 'Sorry, Ella says no. Try again.'\"\n\n\n\nIt works!\n\n\nWhen I'm running locally my build-and-deploy.yml doesn't apply so in that case I typically will do this IF I want my search index (and encryption) updated:\n\n\nyarn start\nyarn encrypt\n\n\n\nWhen I rebuild in production on DigitalOcean my build-and-deploy.yml configuration IS run so including npx pagefind... as part of the yarn encrypt step does the trick.\n\n\n\nTime to Test...\n\n\nI'm going to save this post now and rebuild this blog on DigitalOcean, where with any luck, a search for a term like \"DEEP\" should return this post, and maybe one or two others. Drum roll please... Huzzah!\n\n\n\nMan, Do I Feel Stupid\n\n\nPreviously I mentioned that my additon of a package.json script named pagefind didn't work, and that my DigitalOcean builds kept trying to do yarn encrypt after yarn build. Well, turns out that's because build-and-deploy.yml, where I had inserted the yarn pagefind step IS NOT in control of building my DigitalOcean app. In fact, it's a .github workflow so I'm really not sure what role that file plays, if any?\n\n\nI went looking in my DigitalOcean app configuration settings for yarn encrypt and found it, in the app's \"App Settings\" subsection titled \"App Spec\". When I view that \"App Spec\" I see this:\n\n\nalerts:\n- rule: DEPLOYMENT_FAILED\n- rule: DOMAIN_FAILED\ndomains:\n- domain: blog.summittdweller.com\n  type: PRIMARY\n  zone: summittdweller.com\nenvs:\n- key: TZ\n  scope: RUN_AND_BUILD_TIME\n  value: America/Chicago\nname: blog-summittdweller-11ty-ghost\nregion: nyc\nstatic_sites:\n- build_command: |-\n    yarn build\n    yarn encrypt\n  environment_slug: node-js\n  github:\n    branch: main\n    deploy_on_push: true\n    repo: SummittDweller/blog-eleventy-ghost\n  name: blog-eleventy-ghost\n  output_dir: dist\n  routes:\n  - path: /\n  source_dir: /\n\n\n\nNote the two build_command: elements. Let's change those two steps to three, like so:\n\n\n- build_command: |-\n    yarn build\n    yarn pagefind\n    yarn encrypt\n\n\n\nNote that I captured the \"App Spec\" in a file named blog-summittdweller-11ty-ghost.yaml and I've saved that file in the project directory (where I hope it will do no harm). Attention: After making the aforementioned addition I almost forgot to upload this file back to DigitalOcean to replace our existing App Spec! Don't be stupid like me!\n\n\nNext, I needed a corresponding change in package.json, specifically these two lines (like I had them before, duh):\n\n\n  \"pagefind\": \"npx pagefind --source ./dist\",\n  \"encrypt\": \"staticrypt ./dist/rebuild.html '***hidden***' --short -o ./dist/rebuild.html -f ./src/auth/login.html -t 'Summitt Dweller Blog - Rebuild' -i 'Please enter the passphrase.<br/>Hint: gh0st' --label-error 'Sorry, Ella says no. Try again.'\"\n\n\n\n\nPush to Rebuild\n\n\nOk, having modified and UPLOADED blog-summittdweller-11ty-ghost.yaml, and having modified package.json, it came time to commit and push all my changes to see what happens. Another drum roll, please...\n",

This is not really a problem with Hugo, but one with cloud deployment of Hugo static apps, particularly as an Azure Static Web App.\\n\\n# The Nutshell\\n\\nAs you may know from [post 143](https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/143-significant-rootstalk-retooling/), I have successfully installed and configured [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) in [Rootstalk](https://rootstalk.grinnell.edu), but thus far it only works locally.  When I try to deploy Pagefind to the cloud, specifically as an Azure Static Web App, I can't make it work because there's no apparent way to invoke the necessary `npx pagefind...` command AFTER Hugo compiles the site, but BEFORE the site gets deployed.  Azure leverages GitHub Actions to build Hugo sites, but that process also involves some custom/proprietary Azure scripts.  Therein lies the problem.  \\n\\nThe Azure script auto-detects the presence of a Hugo project, or any one of many other platforms.  That makes the process super-easy to use, but nearly impossible to \\\"customize\\\".  Azure does provide some configuration variables to influence the script behavior, most notably there's an `app_build_command` variable that looks promising, but it only works for `node` builds, and not for Hugo.\\n\\n# Three Possible Solutions\\n\\nI can reasonably see three possible solutions to this dilema.  In order of simplicity they are:\\n\\n## 1. Skip Azure and Deploy Only to DigitalOcean\\n\\nUltimately, Rootstalk's production instance is a DigitalOcean (DO) static web app, Azure is only used for \\\"staging\\\" of a locally viable Rootstalk instance.  DO doesn't use GitHub Actions, a drawback in my book, so its build script, called an \\\"App Spec\\\" in DO, is a little more \\\"open\\\".  The critical portion of the App Spec I use to deploy Rootstalk in DO reads like this:\\n\\n```\\nstatic_sites:\\n- build_command: hugo -d public\\n```\\n\\nThat's it, just a simple `hugo -d public` command.  So, in theory I should be able to just change that to read:\\n\\n```\\nstatic_sites:\\n- build_command: hugo -d public && npm_config_yes=true npx pagefind --source \\\"public\\\" --bundle-dir ../static/_pagefind\\n```\\n\\nIt's basically just a \\\"compound\\\" command to run `npx` immediately after `hugo` is done compiling.  \\n\\nThe problem with this very simple solution, assuming it even works, is that it's somewhat unique to Rootstalk which is already deployed to DigitalOcean.  Other Hugo projects, and I have many like [this blog](https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog), that need Azure or another cloud provider other than DO, would not benefit from this fix.\\n\\n### Update 12-May-2023: Same Problem Exists in DigitalOcean\\n\\nWell, I tried.  I attempted to push my Pagefind additions to Rootstalk forward directly into production on DigitalOcean.  Unfortunately, that failed in similar fashion to what I saw in Azure.  It all works locally, but DigitalOcean, like Azure, has no way of \\\"detecting\\\" that my Hugo project has an NPM component, and therefore takes no steps to build NPM or Pagefind into my solution.  \\n\\nSo, I'm moving on to option #2 below.  Wish me luck.  \\n\\n## 2. Wrap Hugo in `npm`\\n\\nSo, `node` and `npm` seem to be all the rage these days, and perhaps for good reason.  I recently fell in love with [Eleventy/11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) because it's Javascript, not Go, and it's elegantly simple with tons of flexibility.  If my Azure Static Web App was framed in `node.js`, as both _Eleventy_ and _Pagefind_ are, there would be no problem.  The Azure scripts used to deploy those frameworks are far more customizable than Hugo, and there's documentation to prove it.  \\n\\nSo, how might I approach something like this?  Well, [A Powerful Blog Setup with Hugo and NPM](https://www.blogtrack.io/blog/powerful-blog-setup-with-hugo-and-npm/) by Tom Hombergs looks like a promising place to start.  The process that Tom advocates leverages a neat little package called [hugo-bin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hugo-bin).  \\n\\nIf strategy #1 fails I'll certainly give this #2 a try.  Even if #1 works, I might give this strategy a spin if/when I re-tool [this blog](https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog).  \\n\\n## Update 29-May-2023: NPM is GREAT!\\n\\nSince my first option (above) failed very quickly, I moved on to this option and I honestly think I might transition every static site that I have to be wrapped inside NPM, it works wonderfully and is a really attractive solution for so many ills!  \\n\\nI'm going to document my experience with NPM wrapped around Hugo and will post that document here soon, probably as [Wrap EVERYTHING in NPM!](https://blog.summittdweller.com/wrap-everything-in-npm/).  \\n\\n## 3. Transition from Hugo to Eleventy\\n\\nReasonable?  Yes.  A lot of work?  That's relative.  The right thing to do?  Probably.  \\n\\nSo, it's already been done, see [This Blog in Eleventy + Ghost](https://blog.summittdweller.com/this-blog-in-eleventy-ghost/) and [Searching for a Search Solution](https://blog.summittdweller.com/glad-i-found-pagefind/).

As I'm trying to post them to the [theatre's management website](https://wieting-guild.tamatoledo.com) (it's password protected) I keep having issues with `npm` and dependencies that won't compile.  The fix, thus far has included a local command stream like this:  \\n\\n```sh\\ncd wieting-guild-pages\\ngit pull\\ncode .\\nnpm run build\\nnpm run start \\n  --> failed\\nnpm update\\nnpm audit fix\\nnpm run build\\nnpm run start\\n  --> failed\\nnpm audit fix --force\\nnpm run build\\n  --> failed\\nnpm install axios\\nnpm run build\\n  --> failed\\nnpm update\\nnpm run build\\n```  \\n\\nThe last errors had this in common:  \\n\\n```\\n[11ty] Unhandled rejection in promise: (more in DEBUG output)\\n[11ty] connect ETIMEDOUT 54.243.162.8:443 (via Error)\\n[11ty] \\n[11ty] Original error stack trace: Error: connect ETIMEDOUT 54.243.162.8:443\\n[11ty]     at AxiosError.from (/Users/mark/GitHub/wieting-guild-pages/node_modules/axios/dist/node/axios.cjs:836:14)\\n```  \\n\\nOne explanation I found:  \\n\\n```\\nThe ETIMEDOUT error is thrown by the Node.js runtime when a connection or HTTP request is not closed properly after some time. You might encounter this error from time to time if you configured a timeout on your outgoing HTTP requests.

Can I easily \"redefine\" an Azure Static Web App?\n\n\nSo, the source code for my password-protected Wieting-Guild-Pages is broken and I can't update the stale old content that's currently there. It's a long story. Fortunately, I've rebuilt that code in a new GitHub repo and have it working again. Yay!\n\n\nNow, can I take the deployment parts of the old/broken repo and apply them to the new repo and make it all work again?\n\n\n\nWorth a Try\n\n\nSo, I started this experiment by visiting the old project, https://github.com/SummittDweller/wieting-guild-pages, and copying the https://github.com/SummittDweller/wieting-guild-pages/blob/main/.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-lemon-mushroom-087d78210.yml file found there. That GitHub workflow file contains nearly all the information required to deploy the old site, maybe it will work for the new site too? Nope, at least not right out of the box.\n\n\nI attched the .yml file to my new project by placing an unmodified copy of it in the new project's .github/workflows directory. Then when I committed the change and pushed it to GitHub the workflow kicked in automatically. Ultimately it looks like the \"build\" portion of the process worked as-expected, but the \"deployment\" failed with these messages:\n\n\nDeploymentId: 86ab60d0-3abf-429c-9c17-405068c1ebcf\n\ndeployment_token was not provided.\nThe deployment_token is required for deploying content.

Recently, I found [Streamlit DataScience Apps](https://github.com/Jcharis/Streamlit_DataScience_Apps), a _GitHub_ repo full of _Streamlit_ apps, written by [Jcharis](https://github.com/Jcharis/Streamlit_DataScience_Apps/commits?author=Jcharis).  In particular, I thought I would take the [Job_Search_App_with_Streamlit_Forms_n_GithubAPI](https://github.com/Jcharis/Streamlit_DataScience_Apps/tree/master/Job_Search_App_with_Streamlit_Forms_n_GithubAPI) code for a spin.\\n\\nFirst step, I created a new `~/GitHub/` code directory on my Mac; I named my directory `~/GitHub/job-search-app-with-streamlit-forms`.  The plan was to work in that directory inside _VSCode_ with all the project requirements housed in a Python virtual environment (`.venv`) there. \\n\\nThe command stream in my terminal looked like this:\\n\\n```\\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~\\n╰─$ cd ~/GitHub\\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub\\n╰─$ mkdir job-search-app-with-streamlit-forms\\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub\\n╰─$ cd job-search-app-with-streamlit-forms\\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/job-search-app-with-streamlit-forms\\n╰─$ code .\\n```\\n\\nThat last command opened the new directory in _VSCode_ where I had all the tools I needed, including a new terminal window.  In that window I continued with...\\n\\n```\\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/job-search-app-with-streamlit-forms \\n╰─$ python3 -m venv .venv\\n\\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini

In particular, I thought I would take the Job_Search_App_with_Streamlit_Forms_n_GithubAPI code for a spin.\n\n\nFirst step, I created a new ~/GitHub/ code directory on my Mac; I named my directory ~/GitHub/job-search-app-with-streamlit-forms. The plan was to work in that directory inside VSCode with all the project requirements housed in a Python virtual environment (.venv) there.\n\n\nThe command stream in my terminal looked like this:\n\n\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~\n╰─$ cd ~/GitHub\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub\n╰─$ mkdir job-search-app-with-streamlit-forms\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub\n╰─$ cd job-search-app-with-streamlit-forms\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/job-search-app-with-streamlit-forms\n╰─$ code .\n\n\n\nThat last command opened the new directory in VSCode where I had all the tools I needed, including a new terminal window. In that window I continued with...\n\n\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/job-search-app-with-streamlit-forms \n╰─$ python3 -m venv .venv\n\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini

However, there are times when I'm on a geocaching hike and I'd prefer to have a \\\"real\\\" GPS to use.  I also frequently fear that I'll drop and destroy my iPhone while caching, and be left with no GPS and NO way to call for help.  \\n\\nSo, on a recent cross-country geocaching adventure I loaded my trusty old Garmin Oregon 450 to assist, but once on the road I quickly found that the rubber cover on the power button had crumbled from age.  The unit worked but it was certainly not waterproof, not even close, and to be honest, I never really liked the Oregon's touchscreen experience.  The screen frequently needed calibration, was difficult to see at times, and I just didn't use it much.  The old USB mini interface and inability to log finds \\\"live\\\" was also a big drawback.  \\n\\nWhen I got home from that trip I decided it was time for a new GPS and I wanted one with USB rechargable batteries, preferably USB-c, live logging, and NO touchscreen.  That's a pretty good description of the Garmin GPSMAP 67 that I purchased.  \\n\\nMy GPSMAP 67 was delivered about 10 AM yesterday, and the weather was perfect so I made plans to load it up with geocaches and go hunting late that afternoon.  I'm disappointed to report that I never got out of the house, spending several hours trying to load the device. \\n\\n# Initial Problems\\nMy first inclination after reading some of the documentation was to use the \\\"live\\\" feature and my home wi-fi to download some geocaches and go hunting.  I did manage to get some loaded, but the results were not suitable for heading outside.  There were two major issues...  \\n\\n## 5-Mile Search Radius\\n\\nThe first issue is that in this mode the unit apparently searches for up to 25 geocaches that are within a 5-mile radius of the map center, initially the device's location, but this can be changed by panning the map.    \\n\\nThat's all well and good, but all of the geocaches within about 15 miles of home are MINE.  I don't really care to download my own geocaches when I want to go hunting, and the \\\"solution\\\" pointed out another flaw.  \\n\\n## Flawed Filtering\\n\\nOk, so I thought there must be a \\\"filter\\\" feature so that I can be selective about the \\\"live\\\" geocaches my map-center search returns, and there is.  I don't recall all of the filter options, there are a few, but I do remember selecting only caches I have not previously found.  Fine, but the one key filter criteria I really needed is missing...  I am unable to exclude the caches that I OWN.  So, even with filtering turned on my map-center search still returned only caches that I own, and for whatever reason, only 3 of the 60 or so nearby were returned.  \\n\\nClearly this was not going to work.  \\n\\n## Panning the Map\\n\\nSo, I thought I'd better get away from \\\"home\\\" and I had in mind two unfound (by me) geocahes about 20-miles away.  I don't exactly recall the buttons I used but I panned the map center to roughly the location I had in mind and managed to get some geocaches on the map there, but only three caches were shown and none of them was the one I wanted.  Apparently the map center was not quite where it needed to be?  In any event, I deemed this \\\"feature\\\" virtually useless because a 5-mile radius isn't enough when the map center is NOT your current location, and the promise of displaying 25 caches aslo was not fulfilled since I was shown only 3 caches... and I know there were more than that within 5-miles of the map center I had set.  \\n\\n## Conclusions Thus Far\\n\\nThe unit is solid and the buttons make sense so I give the hardware a solid `A`.  The software kind'a sucks, so far it's a `D`, as in dud. It appears the software was written with the device current location in mind, but geocachers don't use GPS units that way, we want to fetch intended targets (with the option to NOT include our own hides) miles from home while we have internet access at home, or at the hotel, or in the campground.  That's the target for 99% of the geocachers I know.  \\n\\n# A Pocket Query + USB Approach\\n\\nI turned from trying to fetch data for caches miles from me using the device, back to the old tried-and-true method, via a Geocahing.com \\\"pocket query\\\".  With pocket queries (PQ) I can control the filtering and the search center location in a number of ways.  Once the PQ is downloaded (a GPX file) I can move it to the device via a USB connection and off I go.  Nope, not with this unit and any of my Mac computers.  \\n\\nI spent the better part of 4 hours trying to transfer a GPX file to the unit to give me geocaches to search for.  I chatted with Garmin support a couple of times and tried dozens of settings and sequences.  Nope.  During one chat session the tech help suggested I try using Windows.  WRONG ANSWER.  That suggestion nearly broke my spirit, so I gave up on USB entirely and ultimately found another way, but it's flawed too.\\n\\n# What Works\\n\\nPress `Menu` twice, select `Setup`, then `Geocaching` and scroll down to `Geocache Lists`.  A list of my downloadable pocket queries (PQs) appears and I select the one I'd like to load, for example, \\\"Local - Not Found\\\" with a count of 500 and status of \\\"Not Synced\\\".  Download of 500 caches took less than 2 minutes, not bad, but I got NOTHING.  Trying that again...  status message says \\\"Basic geocache details downloaded.  Descriptions, Hints and Logs will now be downloaded in the background.\\\"  \\n\\nI go to `Menu` then `Geocaching` (not `Setup`) and still...

Nope, not with this unit and any of my Mac computers.\n\n\nI spent the better part of 4 hours trying to transfer a GPX file to the unit to give me geocaches to search for. I chatted with Garmin support a couple of times and tried dozens of settings and sequences. Nope. During one chat session the tech help suggested I try using Windows. WRONG ANSWER. That suggestion nearly broke my spirit, so I gave up on USB entirely and ultimately found another way, but it's flawed too.\n\n\n\nWhat Works\n\n\nPress Menu twice, select Setup, then Geocaching and scroll down to Geocache Lists. A list of my downloadable pocket queries (PQs) appears and I select the one I'd like to load, for example, \"Local - Not Found\" with a count of 500 and status of \"Not Synced\". Download of 500 caches took less than 2 minutes, not bad, but I got NOTHING. Trying that again... status message says \"Basic geocache details downloaded. Descriptions, Hints and Logs will now be downloaded in the background.\"\n\n\nI go to Menu then Geocaching (not Setup) and still... NOTHING.\n\n\nSo, what worked somewhat last evening, isn't working anymore. Rather frustrating.\n",

            "plaintext": "It's no secret that I love building ridiculously inexpensive but secure and reliable static web sites.  Unfortunately, adding and maintaining content can be a pain.  I'd rather write code than content!  So, I also want to pawn that content responsibility off on others, but that means teaching them to use VSCode – my means of editing static content – or providing a CMS (content management system) they can work with.  There's no such thing as a static CMS so now I need some \"dynamic\" components.  Unfortunately my \"dynamic\" CMS requires user authentication because we want SOMEONE editing our content, not EVERYONE! That always seems to be pricey, at least by comparison to our $5/month static website.    \n\n\nCurrently...\n\nThe Wieting already has an inexpensive Hugo static website at https://Wieting.TamaToledo.com.   The site code and content both reside in GitHub free-of-charge.  The site is currently hosted on Netlify and that costs very little, but also provides meager and dimishing features with virtually no support.  So all of that is good, but could be much better in the near future.  \n\nRight now the CMS portion of the puzzle uses NetlifyCMS which demands either running on Netlify, as it does, or tediously implementing a relatively complex editor authentication scheme elsewhere.  I chose the simple approach of using the Netlify host with it's built-in Netlify Identity features for authentication.  Again, not bad, but not optimal and certainly not sustainable.    \n\nThe other problem with NetlifyCMS is that every change/addition triggers a new automatic deployment of the site.  When the editors make more than one or two changes in rapid succession, which they like to do, the CMS queues up multiple concureent re-builds of the site and those almost always exceed API quota and crash.   So the changes get saved, but not deployed.  \n\n\nThe Future...\n\nSo, what if I could give my \"editors\" access to a free, aka \"open\" CMS, one that doesn't require Netlify or Netlify Identity?  Sounds promising.  I've been looking at StaticCMS, but if I run that CMS in the cloud we still have an \"expensive\" authentication requirement in some form.  Hmmmm, what if that CMS were running locally on my own server so that no cloud authentication is needed?  That could work, right?  Editors could sit down at the server, which is really just a workstation at the theatre, and edit content until the cows come home, with no cloud authentication needed.  Perfect!  \n\nYes, but...  I can't imagine anyone wanting to sit at a workstation in the projection booth to enter content, that place is difficult to access (lots of stairs), way too noisy with the projector running, frequently either too hot or too cold, and it's just not convenient in the least.  \n\n\nRemote Access to the Rescue\n\nTo avoid working in the projection booth, where the noisy projector and computer workstations are, we currently take advantage of remote desktop access using a program I purchased several years ago: Screens.  I have a Screens 4 license that I obtained with a one-time-fee and it works from any of my Macs (or iOS devices) to give me control of the Mac Mini in the booth.  But Screens is Mac-only software.  It has a remote component called Screens Connect that runs on each remote device to make connections super-easy, but Screens Connect doesn't work on Linux systems which require tedios manual configuration instead.  I've spent many hours but have never been able to make the manual configuration work with the Wieting's networking and Kinetic internet connection from Windstream.      \n\nIn addition to Screens, the Wieting has used TeamViewer with our technical service provider, Sonic Equipment Company, for remote connections into the projection booth.  We've never owned a license and purchasing one is cost-prohibitive.  \n\n\nReasonable Remote Access?\n\nScreens just released a new version, Screens 5, and the upgrade costs $$$ but it's still Mac-only and there's still no Linux version of their wonderful Screens Connect app.  So, no thank you.  There must be a reasonable alternative, right?  \n\nYup.  I've signed up for a 30-day trial (I love software that comes with a reasonable trial version and period) of Getscreen.me.   So far it rocks!  Even with my Linux workstations!   Best of all, I believe the Wieting's use case would cost between $60 to $150 per year.  Not too shabby.\n\n\nSummary... the Plan\n\nSo, my plan/proposal is to park a Linux workstation (a PC repurposed with the Ubuntu OS) in the projection booth to support an instance of StaticCMS.  That workstation will be remotely accessible using Getscreen.me and it will be home to a local copy of the Wieting's website.  It will be configured such that StaticCMS can be used to update the local website content, with a link that can be used to push changes to GitHub where changes are deployed to https://wieting.TamaToledo.com hosted in either DigitalOcean or Azure static apps.  \n\n\nBonus!\n\nWithout too much extra effort, the Linux workstation with remote access should also be able to support playback of the Wieting's pre-show content (currently running from an unreliable Raspberry Pi) as well as projector and audio rack controls (currently supplied by our Mac Mini).  \n\n ",

Editors should will be given login credentials to that server where they can run a local copy of the website (it's a Hugo static site) AND a local copy of the CMS editor, make changes, preview them, and commit the changes to the project's GitHub repo.  The website, hosted with _AWS Amplify_ is then automatically updated based on the updated content.  \\n\\n### Along the Way  \\nIt's worth noting that while looking at [StaticCMS](https://www.staticcms.org) I also stumbled upon [tabcms - A CMS that runs in your browser tab](https://mortenson.coffee/work/tabcms/) which might be of interest if \\\"The Plan\\\" doesn't work. \\n\\n## First Steps - Start with a Template\\nI choose the guidance at [Start with a Template](https://www.staticcms.org/docs/start-with-a-template) to get started.  My aim is to clone that repo and build it locally \\\"as-is\\\", then see if I can drop my existing [wieting-ss](https://github.com/SummittServices/wieting-ss) repo into the `site` directory and continue to make it work locally.  \\n\\nIf that works, I'll repeat the same on the Wieting's Ubuntu server and keep pushing forward.

vist to `http://localhost:3000/admin` does indeed open a _StaticCMS_ login that's prompting me with the following image.\\n\\n![Screenshot-2024-01-13-at-11.00.45](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-13-at-11.00.45.png)\\n\\n### Let's Go Local!\\n\\nNext, I'm going to try and switch what we have above to \\\"go local\\\" using [this guidance](https://www.staticcms.org/docs/local-backend) provided in the _StaticCMS_ documenation.  Fingers crossed for good luck...  \\n\\n### Eureka! It Works!\\n\\nSo, I made the `local_backend` config changes as prescribed in `site/static/admin/config.yml` and that file now looks like this:\\n\\n```\\nlocal_backend: \\n  # when using a custom proxy server port\\n  url: http://localhost:8082/api/v1\\n  # when accessing the local site from a host other than 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'\\n  allowed_hosts: ['192.168.0.1']\\n```  \\n\\nI also added a new `.env` file in the project root directory with a single line reading `PORT=8082`, matching the port number specified in the `url:` value from `config.yml`.  \\n\\nNow, with `npx @staticcms/proxy-server` running in a local terminal I'm able to run `npm start` (in my _VSCode_ terminal) to launch the site at `localhost:3000`.  Having done that I'm able to visit `http://localhost:3000/admin` where I get a new _StaticCMS_ splash screen with a simple `Login` button, not a _Netlify_ button.  Yay! \\n\\n### Even Better News?  \\n\\n_StaticCMS_ was built from _NetlifyCMS_ so the `site/static/admin/config.yml`.  I think I'll be able to use the `collections:` portion of my old `admin/config.yml` file from [wieting-one-click-hugo-cms](https://github.com/SummittDweller/wieting-one-click-hugo-cms) to get a headstart on setting that up!  \\n\\nNext step... let's see if I can drop the `site` directory from [wieting-ss](https://github.com/SummittServices/wieting-ss) into this local project and still have a functioning local site.  Again, fingers crossed for luck.  \\n\\n# Fresh Restart\\nIn order to start fresh I went back to the [StaticJsCMS/static-cms-hugo-netlify-template](https://github.com/StaticJsCMS/static-cms-hugo-netlify-template) repo and created a new fork (not a clone) in my `Summitt-Services` team space at [https://github.com/Summitt-Services/static-cms-hugo-local-template](https://github.com/Summitt-Services/static-cms-hugo-local-template).  In the new fork I changed the `-netlify-` portion of the name to `-local-` as this new project is intended to have no _Netlify_ association, only a \\\"local\\\" CMS will be supported.  \\n\\nNext, I cloned the new fork to my workstation and got it working locally again using the same steps I had taken above.  \\n\\n## Copying `wieting-ss` to `static-cms-hugo-local-template`  \\n\\nFor safe-keeping I created a new branch named `wieting` in `~/GitHub/static-cms-hugo-local-template` where I did this:  \\n\\n```zsh\\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/static-cms-hugo-local-template ‹wieting*› \\n╰─$ rsync -aruvi ../wieting-ss/. site/.\\n...\\n>f++++++++++ themes/vanilla-bootstrap-hugo-theme/static/js/checkTweetDate.js\\n>f++++++++++ themes/vanilla-bootstrap-hugo-theme/static/js/feather.min.js\\n>f++++++++++ themes/vanilla-bootstrap-hugo-theme/static/js/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js\\n\\nsent 282,877,469 bytes  received 470,944 bytes  9,605,030.95 bytes/sec\\ntotal size is 470,527,158  speedup is 1.66\\n```\\n\\nWill it work?  Let's see... NOPE.  It does produce a site but the old \\\"Kaldi\\\" content is still all I see.  I even changed the `backend.branch:` value from `main` to `wieting`, but that did nothing.  So, I've captured the output here so that I can have a look at what's happening.  \\n\\n```zsh\\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/static-cms-hugo-local-template ‹wieting*› \\n╰─$ npm start

Editors should will be given login credentials to that server where they can run a local copy of the website (it's a Hugo static site) AND a local copy of the CMS editor, make changes, preview them, and commit the changes to the project's GitHub repo.  The website, hosted with <em>AWS Amplify</em> is then automatically updated based on the updated content.</p>\n<h3 id=\"along-the-way\">Along the Way</h3>\n<p>It's worth noting that while looking at <a href=\"https://www.staticcms.org\">StaticCMS</a> I also stumbled upon <a href=\"https://mortenson.coffee/work/tabcms/\">tabcms - A CMS that runs in your browser tab</a> which might be of interest if &quot;The Plan&quot; doesn't work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"first-stepsstart-with-a-template\">First Steps - Start with a Template</h2>\n<p>I choose the guidance at <a href=\"https://www.staticcms.org/docs/start-with-a-template\">Start with a Template</a> to get started.  My aim is to clone that repo and build it locally &quot;as-is&quot;, then see if I can drop my existing <a href=\"https://github.com/SummittServices/wieting-ss\">wieting-ss</a> repo into the <code>site</code> directory and continue to make it work locally.</p>\n<p>If that works, I'll repeat the same on the Wieting's Ubuntu server and keep pushing forward.

Fingers crossed for good luck...</p>\n<h3 id=\"eureka-it-works\">Eureka! It Works!</h3>\n<p>So, I made the <code>local_backend</code> config changes as prescribed in <code>site/static/admin/config.yml</code> and that file now looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>local_backend: \n  # when using a custom proxy server port\n  url: http://localhost:8082/api/v1\n  # when accessing the local site from a host other than 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'\n  allowed_hosts: ['192.168.0.1']\n</code></pre>\n<p>I also added a new <code>.env</code> file in the project root directory with a single line reading <code>PORT=8082</code>, matching the port number specified in the <code>url:</code> value from <code>config.yml</code>.</p>\n<p>Now, with <code>npx @staticcms/proxy-server</code> running in a local terminal I'm able to run <code>npm start</code> (in my <em>VSCode</em> terminal) to launch the site at <code>localhost:3000</code>.  Having done that I'm able to visit <code>http://localhost:3000/admin</code> where I get a new <em>StaticCMS</em> splash screen with a simple <code>Login</code> button, not a <em>Netlify</em> button.  Yay!</p>\n<h3 id=\"even-better-news\">Even Better News?</h3>\n<p><em>StaticCMS</em> was built from <em>NetlifyCMS</em> so the <code>site/static/admin/config.yml</code>.  I think I'll be able to use the <code>collections:</code> portion of my old <code>admin/config.yml</code> file from <a href=\"https://github.com/SummittDweller/wieting-one-click-hugo-cms\">wieting-one-click-hugo-cms</a> to get a headstart on setting that up!</p>\n<p>Next step... let's see if I can drop the <code>site</code> directory from <a href=\"https://github.com/SummittServices/wieting-ss\">wieting-ss</a> into this local project and still have a functioning local site.  Again, fingers crossed for luck.</p>\n<h1 id=\"fresh-restart\">Fresh Restart</h1>\n<p>In order to start fresh I went back to the <a href=\"https://github.com/StaticJsCMS/static-cms-hugo-netlify-template\">StaticJsCMS/static-cms-hugo-netlify-template</a> repo and created a new fork (not a clone) in my <code>Summitt-Services</code> team space at <a href=\"https://github.com/Summitt-Services/static-cms-hugo-local-template\">https://github.com/Summitt-Services/static-cms-hugo-local-template</a>.  In the new fork I changed the <code>-netlify-</code> portion of the name to <code>-local-</code> as this new project is intended to have no <em>Netlify</em> association, only a &quot;local&quot; CMS will be supported.</p>\n<p>Next, I cloned the new fork to my workstation and got it working locally again using the same steps I had taken above.</p>\n<h2 id=\"copying-wieting-ss-to-static-cms-hugo-local-template\">Copying <code>wieting-ss</code> to <code>static-cms-hugo-local-template</code></h2>\n<p>For safe-keeping I created a new branch named <code>wieting</code> in <code>~/GitHub/static-cms-hugo-local-template</code> where I did this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-zsh\">╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/static-cms-hugo-local-template ‹wieting*› \n╰─$ rsync -aruvi ../wieting-ss/. site/.\n...\n&gt;f++++++++++ themes/vanilla-bootstrap-hugo-theme/static/js/checkTweetDate.js\n&gt;f++++++++++ themes/vanilla-bootstrap-hugo-theme/static/js/feather.min.js\n&gt;f++++++++++ themes/vanilla-bootstrap-hugo-theme/static/js/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js\n\nsent 282,877,469 bytes  received 470,944 bytes  9,605,030.95 bytes/sec\ntotal size is 470,527,158  speedup is 1.66\n</code></pre>\n<p>Will it work?

Editors should will be given login credentials to that server where they can run a local copy of the website (it's a Hugo static site) AND a local copy of the CMS editor, make changes, preview them, and commit the changes to the project's GitHub repo. The website, hosted with AWS Amplify is then automatically updated based on the updated content.\n\n\n\nAlong the Way\n\n\nIt's worth noting that while looking at StaticCMS I also stumbled upon tabcms - A CMS that runs in your browser tab which might be of interest if \"The Plan\" doesn't work.\n\n\n\nFirst Steps - Start with a Template\n\n\nI choose the guidance at Start with a Template to get started. My aim is to clone that repo and build it locally \"as-is\", then see if I can drop my existing wieting-ss repo into the site directory and continue to make it work locally.\n\n\nIf that works, I'll repeat the same on the Wieting's Ubuntu server and keep pushing forward. Wish me luck?\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nFollowing the Local Development guidance found me cloning this template then...\n\n\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/static-cms-hugo-netlify-template ‹main›

following image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's Go Local!\n\n\nNext, I'm going to try and switch what we have above to \"go local\" using this guidance provided in the StaticCMS documenation. Fingers crossed for good luck...\n\n\n\nEureka! It Works!\n\n\nSo, I made the local_backend config changes as prescribed in site/static/admin/config.yml and that file now looks like this:\n\n\nlocal_backend: \n  # when using a custom proxy server port\n  url: http://localhost:8082/api/v1\n  # when accessing the local site from a host other than 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'\n  allowed_hosts: ['192.168.0.1']\n\n\n\nI also added a new .env file in the project root directory with a single line reading PORT=8082, matching the port number specified in the url: value from config.yml.\n\n\nNow, with npx @staticcms/proxy-server running in a local terminal I'm able to run npm start (in my VSCode terminal) to launch the site at localhost:3000. Having done that I'm able to visit http://localhost:3000/admin where I get a new StaticCMS splash screen with a simple Login button, not a Netlify button. Yay!\n\n\n\nEven Better News?\n\n\nStaticCMS was built from NetlifyCMS so the site/static/admin/config.yml. I think I'll be able to use the collections: portion of my old admin/config.yml file from wieting-one-click-hugo-cms to get a headstart on setting that up!\n\n\nNext step... let's see if I can drop the site directory from wieting-ss into this local project and still have a functioning local site. Again, fingers crossed for luck.\n\n\n\nFresh Restart\n\n\nIn order to start fresh I went back to the StaticJsCMS/static-cms-hugo-netlify-template repo and created a new fork (not a clone) in my Summitt-Services team space at https://github.com/Summitt-Services/static-cms-hugo-local-template. In the new fork I changed the -netlify- portion of the name to -local- as this new project is intended to have no Netlify association, only a \"local\" CMS will be supported.\n\n\nNext, I cloned the new fork to my workstation and got it working locally again using the same steps I had taken above.\n\n\n\nCopying wieting-ss to static-cms-hugo-local-template\n\n\nFor safe-keeping I created a new branch named wieting in ~/GitHub/static-cms-hugo-local-template where I did this:\n\n\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/static-cms-hugo-local-template ‹wieting*› \n╰─$ rsync -aruvi ../wieting-ss/. site/.\n...\n>f++++++++++ themes/vanilla-bootstrap-hugo-theme/static/js/checkTweetDate.js\n>f++++++++++ themes/vanilla-bootstrap-hugo-theme/static/js/feather.min.js\n>f++++++++++ themes/vanilla-bootstrap-hugo-theme/static/js/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js\n\nsent 282,877,469 bytes  received 470,944 bytes  9,605,030.95 bytes/sec\ntotal size is 470,527,158  speedup is 1.66\n\n\n\nWill it work? Let's see... NOPE. It does produce a site but the old \"Kaldi\" content is still all I see. I even changed the backend.branch: value from main to wieting, but that did nothing. So, I've captured the output here so that I can have a look at what's happening.\n\n\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/static-cms-hugo-local-template ‹wieting*› \n╰─$ npm start                               \n\n> static-cms-hugo-netlify-template@1.0.0 start\n> run-p start:**\n\n\n> static-cms-hugo-netlify-template@1.0.0 start:webpack\n> webpack-dev-server --config webpack.dev.js --hot --stats-error-details\n\n\n> static-cms-hugo-netlify-template@1.0.0 start:hugo\n> hugo -d ../dist -s site -vw\n\nWARN  --verbose was deprecated in Hugo v0.114.0 and will be removed in a future release. use --logLevel info\nStart building sites … \nhugo v0.120.1-16fb2cae88eb6add7d12e9fbfcf01d8670e60a35 darwin/amd64 BuildDate=2023-10-30T16:44:31Z VendorInfo=gohugoio\n\nINFO  copy static: syncing static files to /\nINFO  build: running step process duration 4.236952ms\nINFO  build: running step assemble duration 13.684119ms\nWARN  found no layout file for \"json\" for kind \"section\": You should create a template file which matches Hugo Layouts Lookup Rules for this combination.\nINFO  build: running step render duration 58.753135ms\nINFO  build: running step postProcess duration 8.744µs\n\n                   | EN   \n-------------------+------\n  Pages            |  66  \n  Paginator pages  |   7  \n  Non-page files   |   0  \n  Static files     | 541  \n  Processed images |   0  \n  Aliases          |   7  \n  Sitemaps         |   1  \n  Cleaned          |   0  \n\nBuilt in 579 ms\nWatching for changes in /Users/mark/GitHub/static-cms-hugo-local-template/site/{archetypes,content,data,layouts,package.json,static,themes}\nWatching for config changes in /Users/mark/GitHub/static-cms-hugo-local-template/site/config.toml, /Users/mark/GitHub/static-cms-hugo-local-template/site/config/_default\nPress Ctrl+C to stop\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] Project is running at:\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] Loopback: http://localhost:3000/\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] On Your Network (IPv4): http://192.168.0.183:3000/\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] On Your Network (IPv6): http://[fe80::1]:3000/\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] Content not from webpack is served from '/Users/mark/GitHub/static-cms-hugo-local-template/dist' directory\n<i> [webpack-dev-server] 404s will fallback to '/index.html'\n<i> [webpack-dev-middleware] wait until bundle finished: /\nassets by path *.js 18.3 MiB\n  asset cms.js 18 MiB [emitted] (name: cms)\n  asset main.js 300 KiB [emitted] (name: main)\nasset main.css 113 KiB [emitted] (name: main)\nasset admin/index.html 521 bytes [emitted]\nasset fonts/.keep 0 bytes [emitted] [from: src/fonts/.keep] [copied]\nEntrypoint main 413 KiB = main.css 113 KiB main.js 300 KiB\nEntrypoint cms 18 MiB = cms.js\nruntime modules 72.3 KiB 38 modules\nmodules by path ./node_modules/ 16.9 MiB 82 modules\nmodules by path ./src/ 133 KiB (javascript) 113 KiB (css/mini-extract)\n  modules by path ./src/js/ 15.2 KiB 9 modules\n  modules by path ./src/css/*.scss 118 KiB (javascript) 113 KiB (css/mini-extract)\n    ./src/css/main.scss 2.78 KiB [built] [code generated]\n    ./node_modules/to-string-loader/src/to-string.js!./node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js!./node_modules/postcss-loader/dist/cjs.js!./node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js!./src/css/main.scss 429 bytes [built] [code generated]\n    ./node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ruleSet[1].rules[2].use[1]!./node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js!./node_modules/postcss-loader/dist/cjs.js!./node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js!./src/css/main.scss 332 bytes [built] [code generated]\n    + 2 modules\n  ./src/index.js 124 bytes [built] [code generated]\nasset modules 5.46 KiB\n  data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAAN.. 1.28 KiB [built] [code generated] [build time executed]\n  data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAAN.. 1.33 KiB [built] [code generated] [build time executed]\n  data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4QAYRXhpZgAA.. 1.55 KiB [built] [code generated] [build time executed]\n  data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAAN.. 1.3 KiB [built] [code generated] [build time executed]\nwebpack 5.89.0 compiled successfully in 5563 ms\nINFO  Received System Events: [CHMOD         \"/Users/mark/GitHub/static-cms-hugo-local-template/site/data/webpack.json\" WRITE         \"/Users/mark/GitHub/static-cms-hugo-local-template/site/data/webpack.json\"]\n\nChange detected, rebuilding site.\n2024-01-13 13:15:08.329 -0600\nData changed WRITE         \"/Users/mark/GitHub/static-cms-hugo-local-template/site/data/webpack.json\"\nINFO  build: running step process duration 186.604µs\nINFO  build: running step assemble duration 244ns\nWARN  found no layout file for \"json\" for kind \"section\": You should create a template file which matches Hugo Layouts Lookup Rules for this combination.\nINFO  build: running step render duration 31.514265ms\nINFO  build: running step postProcess duration 7.661µs\nTotal in 31 ms\n^C<i> [webpack-dev-server] Gracefully shutting down.

It contains only \"Kaldi\" content. So I tried removing that _index.md file and that changed the home page \"title\", but very little else.\n\n\nI think returing to the main branch of this project and starting over again but using only the content of wieting-ss in the new site/ directory might be wise. I did it like this:\n\n\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub\n╰─$ rm -fr static-cms-hugo-local-template\n╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub\n╰─$ git clone

works.

Still, that's a WIN!\n\n\n\nTime To Save My Progress\n\n\nI really don't want to dump 4000+ new files, many of them specific to the Wieting website, into my pristine (and working) https://github.com/Summitt-Services/static-cms-hugo-local-template GitHub repository. So, I'm going to clean up my local project by removing that which is no longer needed, and then I'm going to remove the .git directory and create/populate a new wieting-staticCMS private repository.
