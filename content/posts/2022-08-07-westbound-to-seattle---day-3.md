# Day 3 - Moses Lake, WA to Seattle

This is our planned route for Day 3 using a `speed factor of 1.0` (traveling at the speed limit).  Fuel cost is based on `40 mpg` and `$4.00 per gallon` averages.  Fuel stops typically have a 15-minute duration and rest areas allow 5-minutes each.

A list of possible geocache targets for the entire route can be found at [https://www.geocaching.com/play/map/lists/BMBBMD6](https://www.geocaching.com/play/map/lists/BMBBMD6).
