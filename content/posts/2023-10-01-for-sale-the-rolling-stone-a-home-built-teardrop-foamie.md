About 18 months ago I bought a new-to-me Aliner Scout camper and "The Rolling Stone", my home-built teardrop foamie has been in storage ever since.  I don't want to store it again this winter so it's finally time to sell it.

The unit is road-ready and super lite (I used to tow it with a Toyota RAV4), and dry as ever in the interior after more than 7 years of use.  Search "teardrop foamie" on the web and you'll get a sense of what this is and how one is built.

This unit is built to accomodate a queen size mattress, but I've installed a small room air conditioning unit and marine battery with a full-size mattress instead.  It's made mostly of foam insulation so it's easy to cool in the summer and I kept it warm in the winter using a small electric space heater.  It does have a 110v shore power connection that works nicely.  There's a ceiling-mounted, thermostat-controlled DC exhaust fan and built-in DC interior lights too.

I'm **asking $1500 or make an offer** for the unit.

Going to post some photos of the exterior and interior here but you need to see this thing in-person to really appreciate it.

I also plan to link to this listing from a Facebook Marketplace post.

The unit is available to view in Toledo, Iowa.  Please contact me via email to [mark@tamatoledo.net](mail://mark@tamatoledo.net) to discuss and arrange a visit.  I also plan to link to this listing from a Facebook Marketplace post where you can contact me via Messenger, although I prefer email.

If there's lots of interest I can take some measurements and probably add dimensions to this listing.  Towing requires a 2" ball.
