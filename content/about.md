Summitt Dweller's Blog is an independent publication launched in March 2023 by Mark McFate, aka "Summitt Dweller".  It replaces an old [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site which replaced an old [Drupal](https://drupal.org) site many years ago.

### Eleventy (11ty) + Ghost

This past weekend my daughter, Mackenzie, made the decision to move her portfolio page into a configuration that features Eleventy (11ty) on the frontend with content managed in Ghost on the backend.  I like that combination very much so to help support her move, and learn a little something along the way, we've setup a new Ghost server in a DigitalOcean droplet, namely `ghostonubuntu2204-s-1vcpu-1gb-intel-nyc1-01` , and I've decided to make the same move myself.

This post is intended to track my blog's journey from a `git` workflow (for both structure and content) in Hugo, to Eleventy + Ghost, and it begins with the guidance provided in [https://github.com/TryGhost/eleventy-starter-ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/eleventy-starter-ghost?ref=blog-ghost.summittservices.com). I already have a working Ghost server as mentioned above, the one that we setup for Mackenzie's portfolio, and we've already followed [Install and host Multiple Ghost blog Servers on One Server](https://hooshmand.net/host-a-second-or-multiple-ghost-blogs-on-one-server/?ref=blog-ghost.summittservices.com) to create the Ghost backend for this blog on the same DO droplet that host's Mackenzie's portfolio content.
