I use Azure Blob Storage quite a bit these days, at work and here at home.  Recently a student I've been working with turned my attention to [this post from Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/blob-storage-image-upload-static-web-apps/1-introduction) and this week I'm going to take a crack at putting it to use, perhaps in association with this blog.
