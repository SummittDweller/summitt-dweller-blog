As I started to follow-up on Gating My Content & More - Parts 1 and 2 I quickly realized that I've already forgotten most of what I learned about eleventy back in December. So, since I already have years of Hugo experience, I elected to begin again with Migrating from Hugo to Eleventy and that article makes an early reference to A Deep Dive Into Eleventy Static Site Generator. If those fail there's Let's Learn Eleventy. In case it's needed later, I captured all of the sites listed above in a OneTab page.
