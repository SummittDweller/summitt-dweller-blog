Ya' gotta love Hugo! I just completed my first Jekyll-to-Hugo conversion, and made it a Hugo module. It's taken me a couple of years to realize the power of Hugo modules, and I have to say it's AWESOME, and perfectly implemented.The process of conversion briefly is documented in the README.md file at SummittDweller/hugo-timeline, and the first use of it as a module appears elsewhere in this blog at My Hugo Timeline, A New Hugo Module. The timeline itself can be seen at https://blog.SummittDweller.com/timeline. Check it out!
