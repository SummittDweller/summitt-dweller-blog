So, the probe Z-offset on my printer seems to be wonky.  I noticed during bed leveling that my print head is contacting the bed of my printer just BEFORE the probe is triggered.  That's not good!  I'm going to have a look at [BLTouch / CR Touch Z Offset (Z Probe Offset) Calibration in Marlin Firmware](https://www.3dprintgorilla.com/bltouch-crtouch-z-probe-offset-calibration-in-marlin/) to see if I can correct that posthaste.
