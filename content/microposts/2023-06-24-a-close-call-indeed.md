Driving home from a few days at Univ. of South Dakota in Vermillion last evening and stopped at Justin's house in M-town to meet his parents and grandmother, plus Deb & Doug.  We left there about 8:30 or so and I took the old Lincoln Highway into town to avoid deer along the road on the shorter rural route.

We nearly got hit by an impaired driver (?) when turning on to Center Street just south of the Hy-Vee / Taco John's intersection.  Fortunately for us, a large SUV (Suburban?) took the force of the impact while vehicles and debris flew all around us.  Nobody was injured and there's not a scratch (that we can see) on the new Kia, but we didn't get home until a little after 10 PM.
