Last weekend Mackenzie and I created a new Matomo analytics server on a DigitalOcean droplet w/ 2G of RAM. This weekend we created a new headless Ghost CMS droplet to support her portfolio site, and more.This evening I'm taking steps to begin rewriting this blog as a Ghost + 11ty reincarnation of what you see here now. The story of the underlying Ghost development and maintenance is told in Ghost Notes and its admin dashboard is available at [https://ghost.summittservices.com/ghost](https://ghost.summittservices.com/ghost).
