I ran into a big road block with implementation of Pagefind in *Rootstalk* today... everything works fine in development, but I can't easily deploy to *Azure* because there's no way to "inject" Pagefind into an Azure Static Web App build before the "public" content gets deployed.  I can generate the Pagefind parts after deployment, but that does me no good.

Tomorrow I need to have a look at my *Rootstalk* DigitalOcean deployment to see if what I already have might work there (DO uses a build script that I can add an `npx...` command to).  If that fails I need to look back at [https://www.blogtrack.io/blog/powerful-blog-setup-with-hugo-and-npm/](https://www.blogtrack.io/blog/powerful-blog-setup-with-hugo-and-npm/) to see if there's a solution there for me.
