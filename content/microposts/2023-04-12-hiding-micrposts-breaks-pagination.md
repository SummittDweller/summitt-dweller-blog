So, since I could not get back to sleep this morning I started looking at this blog and wondering why my home page pagination isn't right?  After a little sleuthing I found that my custom logic to "hide all microposts from the home page" is working just as one might expect, except that this screws up the number of visible posts per page.  Hmmm, this needs some work. Guess I need to legitimately funnel microposts into an entirely separate collection!

**Done!**
