This morning's Ghost/11ty adventure will hopefully find me adding a new collection to both ends of this blog.  See [Building content collections](https://ghost.org/tutorials/content-collections/).

Note: Using an internal tag, `#micropost`, for this did NOT work, at least it did not change the slug as expected.  Using `micropost` does work!
