This morning I found some new *Streamlit* resources from developer **Jcharis**, and I forked his [Jcharis/Streamlit_DataScience_Apps](https://github.com/Jcharis/Streamlit_DataScience_Apps) to make my own copy at [SummittDweller/Streamlit_DataScience_Apps](https://github.com/SummittDweller/Streamlit_DataScience_Apps)

Now I'm going to try and get the component *Simple_CRuD_Blog_App_with_Streamlit* working locally as a proof-of-concept.  Since I can't "clone" the single project repo, and a "sparse checkout" seems wasteful since I'll never push back to the original project, I'm going to `git init` an entirely new local named *simple-CRuD-blog-app-with-streamlit* and just copy/paste the contents.

It works!
