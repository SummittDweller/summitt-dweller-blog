Arrived at Fisherman's Corner campground in Hampton, IL, on Thursday evening and went on my first Iowa.LandShark geo-bike ride yesterday.  Somewhere between 18-22 miles of geocaching along the Mississippi River from Moline to Davenport and Rock Island.  Open my [track log](https://hikes.summittdweller.com/hikes/2023/06/2023-06-09_5.47pm/) to see where Gossamar and I went.
