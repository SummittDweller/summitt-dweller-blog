Just thought I would post a couple more photos, with a probable update later today.  Took these photos yesterday (Friday, January 12) at about noon when I ventured outside to clear the driveway.  Didn't quite get it all done because it was just too cold and windy, and the snow was still falling.  I didn't even attempt to clear the front porch... ain't nobody coming to visit today anyway.  8^)

I love my EGO snow thrower, but pushing through drifts that are taller than the intake (about 18") is NO FUN.
