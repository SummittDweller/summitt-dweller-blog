Now that I’ve cleared the driveway of the latest snowfall, I am officially declaring this to be “**My MQTT Weekend**”.  It actually started on Friday night, the weekend, not the snow.  Rather than posting a lot of gibberish here, I’ll just point you to my project repo at [https://github.com/SummittDweller/Motorized_MQTT_Blinds](https://github.com/SummittDweller/Motorized_MQTT_Blinds) and especially the [Additional Resources](https://github.com/SummittDweller/Motorized_MQTT_Blinds#additional-resources) portion of the *README.md* file there.  If/when I get this all working maybe I will post some photos, maybe.
