I am back on my iPhone testing the Ghost Publisher app once more.  The problem here is that the "tags" feature doesn't appear to work at all?  I could fork the code ([https://github.com/willowsokora/Ghost-Publisher](https://github.com/willowsokora/Ghost-Publisher)) and try to "fix" it... nah.  Maybe Mackenzie wants to learn some *Swift* programming?  Or, more likely, let's see what she can do with *Apple Shortcuts* and the [Ghost Admin API]([https://ghost.org/docs/admin-api/?_ga=2.258407498.1118611505.1680637422-1629315755.1679183141](https://ghost.org/docs/admin-api/?_ga=2.258407498.1118611505.1680637422-1629315755.1679183141)).
