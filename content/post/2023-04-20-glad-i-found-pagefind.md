A few months ago I sat in on a [CFE.dev webinar](https://cfe.dev/sessions/static-search-with-pagefind/) and I was really impressed with what I saw.  I made a note to come back and look closer at [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/), and my new blog -- this blog that you're presumably reading right now -- really needed a search feature, so the "Search" box on this page (I hope it's there) is the outcome.

## Glad I Found Pagefind

So, I started looking closely at search options and considered things like [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/), which I've used before, and [Solr](https://solr.apache.org/), which I both love and hate (because of its JAVA roots).  Pagefind was, of course, also on that short list and it quickly solidified its position at the top of the list when I found [Adding search to an Eleventy site](https://mikefallows.com/posts/adding-search-to-eleventy-site/) by [Mike](https://mikefallows.com/about/).

Mike doesn't explain the setup in detail, but this comment really resonated with me so I decided to follow the same path:

> Weirdly, I've found that I seem to read the posts on this site more than I write them. I say read, but I just mean referring to the stuff I've written because it has left my head.

Mike does provide a link to the reference he used, namely [Using PageFind with Eleventy for Search](https://rknight.me/using-pagefind-with-eleventy-for-search/) by [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/).  I found Robb's guidance and experience to be VERY helpful.  Thank you, Robb!

## Implementing Robb's Approach

I won't bother duplicating what Robb explains quite well, but this wasn't a 10-minute solution for me, probably because I'm really still learning *Javascript* and *Eleventy*, and also because I'm using a *Ghost* back-end with packages managed via *Yarn* rather than *npm*.

So, in the few sections that follow I'll try to briefly described what's different about my approach versus Robb's, along with what didn't, and what ultimately did work.

## `yarn`, Not `npm`

The first significant difference I encountered was the requirement that this blog project uses `yarn`, not `npm` for package management.  Eventually I found that I just needed to replace Robb's `npm install pagefind` command with a `yarn add pagefind` equivalent.  I don't really understand the details of that difference, but it worked.

## eleventy.after Never Fires?

The biggest hurdle for me was trying to get this bit of Robb's code to work.

    const { execSync } = require('child_process')
    
    module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
      eleventyConfig.on('eleventy.after', () => {
        execSync(`npx pagefind --source _site --glob \"**/*.html\"`, { encoding: 'utf-8' })
      })
    }
    

In my case the `--source` parameter needed to be `dist` since this blog is generated into a directory by that name, and my configuration object is simply `config` rather than `eleventyConfig`.  I made those simple changes and added my snippet to the `.eleventy.js` file, but found that it never triggered.  I even replaced the `execSync` function call with a simple `console.log` statement and still got nothing.  And still to this day, I have no idea why that didn't work.

That snippet of code is supposed to be responsible for indexing all of the `.html` files after *Eleventy* has generated them.  Well, I found out that everything else was working properly, but the `_pagefind` bundle generated by that indexing operation was just "missing", since the index never was created.  That made me wonder what would happen if I "forced" the system to index my content in a different manner...and that wonder ultimately worked.

## Using `npx pagefind...` to Index Content

Having studied some of the [Pagefind documentation](https://pagefind.app/docs/) I wondered what adding some post-processing to my build workflow might do, something like `npx pagefind --source dist`?  That ultimately worked, but not in that original form.

I found that when I ran `yarn start` to locally rebuild the site, there was no generated `./dist/_pagefind` bundle present, so I got no "Search" user interface elements, but there was an empty `<div>` where that belonged.  So, with my localhost instance still running I opened a new terminal and ran `npx pagefind --source dist` in the project directory. Voila! The `./dist/_pagefind` bundle magically appeared and the "Search" control was instantly visible in my localhost window!  It was working, and it was beautiful.

## Added a `pagefind` Script... Didn't Work

Ok, with the above breakthrough in-hand I made this addition to the `scripts:` key in my `package.json` file:

      "pagefind": "npx pagefind --source dist"
    

Then I added the following to the end of my `steps:` key in `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml`:

      - run: yarn pagefind
    

This worked to some extent, but wasn't reliable and absolutely didn't work when deployed to my *DigitalOcean* app.  The inner-workings of `yarn` and build caching in these environments is still a DEEP mystery to me!

## Extending My `encrypt` Script

What does work, both locally and on *DigitalOcean*, is essentially an "extension" of my old `encrypt` script.  My old build workflow included these two elements of `package.json` and `build-and-deploy.yml`:

        "encrypt": "staticrypt ./dist/rebuild.html '***hidden***' --short -o ./dist/rebuild.html -f ./src/auth/login.html -t 'Summitt Dweller Blog - Rebuild' -i 'Please enter the passphrase.<br/>Hint: gh0st' --label-error 'Sorry, Ella says no. Try again.'"
    

...and...

      - run: yarn encrypt
    

I took note of the relative path spec for `./dist/rebuild.html` in the `encrypt` command, reasoned that I should run `pagefind` in a similar fashion -- but just before encryption -- and came up with this change in `package.json`:

        "encrypt": "npx pagefind --source ./dist && staticrypt ./dist/rebuild.html '***hidden***' --short -o ./dist/rebuild.html -f ./src/auth/login.html -t 'Summitt Dweller Blog - Rebuild' -i 'Please enter the passphrase.<br/>Hint: gh0st' --label-error 'Sorry, Ella says no. Try again.'"
    

**It works!**

When I'm running locally my `build-and-deploy.yml` doesn't apply so in that case I typically will do this IF I want my search index (and encryption) updated:

    yarn start
    yarn encrypt
    

When I rebuild in production on *DigitalOcean* my `build-and-deploy.yml` configuration IS run so including `npx pagefind...` as part of the `yarn encrypt` step does the trick.

## Time to Test...

I'm going to save this post now and rebuild this blog on *DigitalOcean*, where with any luck, a search for a term like "DEEP" should return this post, and maybe one or two others.  Drum roll please...  **Huzzah!**

## Man, Do I Feel Stupid

Previously I mentioned that my additon of a `package.json` script named `pagefind` didn't work, and that my *DigitalOcean* builds kept trying to do `yarn encrypt` after `yarn build`.  Well, turns out that's because `build-and-deploy.yml`, where I had inserted the `yarn pagefind` step IS NOT in control of building my *DigitalOcean* app.  In fact, it's a `.github` workflow so I'm really not sure what role that file plays, if any?

I went looking in my *DigitalOcean* app configuration settings for `yarn encrypt` and found it, in the app's "App Settings" subsection titled "App Spec".  When I view that "App Spec" I see this:

    alerts:
    - rule: DEPLOYMENT_FAILED
    - rule: DOMAIN_FAILED
    domains:
    - domain: blog.summittdweller.com
      type: PRIMARY
      zone: summittdweller.com
    envs:
    - key: TZ
      scope: RUN_AND_BUILD_TIME
      value: America/Chicago
    name: blog-summittdweller-11ty-ghost
    region: nyc
    static_sites:
    - build_command: |-
        yarn build
        yarn encrypt
      environment_slug: node-js
      github:
        branch: main
        deploy_on_push: true
        repo: SummittDweller/blog-eleventy-ghost
      name: blog-eleventy-ghost
      output_dir: dist
      routes:
      - path: /
      source_dir: /
    

Note the two `build_command:` elements.  Let's change those two steps to three, like so:

    - build_command: |-
        yarn build
        yarn pagefind
        yarn encrypt
    

Note that I captured the "App Spec" in a file named `blog-summittdweller-11ty-ghost.yaml` and I've saved that file in the project directory (where I hope it will do no harm).  **Attention: After making the aforementioned addition I almost forgot to upload this file back to *DigitalOcean* to replace our existing App Spec!**  Don't be stupid like me!

Next, I needed a corresponding change in `package.json`, specifically these two lines (like I had them before, duh):

      "pagefind": "npx pagefind --source ./dist",
      "encrypt": "staticrypt ./dist/rebuild.html '***hidden***' --short -o ./dist/rebuild.html -f ./src/auth/login.html -t 'Summitt Dweller Blog - Rebuild' -i 'Please enter the passphrase.<br/>Hint: gh0st' --label-error 'Sorry, Ella says no. Try again.'"
    

## Push to Rebuild

Ok, having modified **and UPLOADED**`blog-summittdweller-11ty-ghost.yaml`, and having modified `package.json`, it came time to commit and push all my changes to see what happens.  Another drum roll, please...
