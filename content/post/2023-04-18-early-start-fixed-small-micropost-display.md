I got an early start this morning (awake at 5:30 so what the heck) and had to restart my Grinnell College MacBook (which is still rebooting!) so I took a few minutes to debug the `micropost` content in this blog.  Turns out I had a regex expression that was a little too aggressive.  Removed that (it wasn't entirely necessary) and all is well now.
