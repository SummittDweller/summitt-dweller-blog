I generally go geocaching with my iPhone and *Cachly*, and it's a great combination because I can find caches AND log them live once found.  However, there are times when I'm on a geocaching hike and I'd prefer to have a "real" GPS to use.  I also frequently fear that I'll drop and destroy my iPhone while caching, and be left with no GPS and NO way to call for help.

So, on a recent cross-country geocaching adventure I loaded my trusty old Garmin Oregon 450 to assist, but once on the road I quickly found that the rubber cover on the power button had crumbled from age.  The unit worked but it was certainly not waterproof, not even close, and to be honest, I never really liked the Oregon's touchscreen experience.  The screen frequently needed calibration, was difficult to see at times, and I just didn't use it much.  The old USB mini interface and inability to log finds "live" was also a big drawback.

When I got home from that trip I decided it was time for a new GPS and I wanted one with USB rechargable batteries, preferably USB-c, live logging, and NO touchscreen.  That's a pretty good description of the Garmin GPSMAP 67 that I purchased.

My GPSMAP 67 was delivered about 10 AM yesterday, and the weather was perfect so I made plans to load it up with geocaches and go hunting late that afternoon.  I'm disappointed to report that I never got out of the house, spending several hours trying to load the device.

# Initial Problems

My first inclination after reading some of the documentation was to use the "live" feature and my home wi-fi to download some geocaches and go hunting.  I did manage to get some loaded, but the results were not suitable for heading outside.  There were two major issues...

## 5-Mile Search Radius

The first issue is that in this mode the unit apparently searches for up to 25 geocaches that are within a 5-mile radius of the map center, initially the device's location, but this can be changed by panning the map.

That's all well and good, but all of the geocaches within about 15 miles of home are MINE.  I don't really care to download my own geocaches when I want to go hunting, and the "solution" pointed out another flaw.

## Flawed Filtering

Ok, so I thought there must be a "filter" feature so that I can be selective about the "live" geocaches my map-center search returns, and there is.  I don't recall all of the filter options, there are a few, but I do remember selecting only caches I have not previously found.  Fine, but the one key filter criteria I really needed is missing...  I am unable to exclude the caches that I OWN.  So, even with filtering turned on my map-center search still returned only caches that I own, and for whatever reason, only 3 of the 60 or so nearby were returned.

Clearly this was not going to work.

## Panning the Map

So, I thought I'd better get away from "home" and I had in mind two unfound (by me) geocahes about 20-miles away.  I don't exactly recall the buttons I used but I panned the map center to roughly the location I had in mind and managed to get some geocaches on the map there, but only three caches were shown and none of them was the one I wanted.  Apparently the map center was not quite where it needed to be?  In any event, I deemed this "feature" virtually useless because a 5-mile radius isn't enough when the map center is NOT your current location, and the promise of displaying 25 caches aslo was not fulfilled since I was shown only 3 caches... and I know there were more than that within 5-miles of the map center I had set.

## Conclusions Thus Far

The unit is solid and the buttons make sense so I give the hardware a solid `A`.  The software kind'a sucks, so far it's a `D`, as in dud. It appears the software was written with the device current location in mind, but geocachers don't use GPS units that way, we want to fetch intended targets (with the option to NOT include our own hides) miles from home while we have internet access at home, or at the hotel, or in the campground.  That's the target for 99% of the geocachers I know.

# A Pocket Query + USB Approach

I turned from trying to fetch data for caches miles from me using the device, back to the old tried-and-true method, via a Geocahing.com "pocket query".  With pocket queries (PQ) I can control the filtering and the search center location in a number of ways.  Once the PQ is downloaded (a GPX file) I can move it to the device via a USB connection and off I go.  Nope, not with this unit and any of my Mac computers.

I spent the better part of 4 hours trying to transfer a GPX file to the unit to give me geocaches to search for.  I chatted with Garmin support a couple of times and tried dozens of settings and sequences.  Nope.  During one chat session the tech help suggested I try using Windows.  WRONG ANSWER.  That suggestion nearly broke my spirit, so I gave up on USB entirely and ultimately found another way, but it's flawed too.

# What Works

Press `Menu` twice, select `Setup`, then `Geocaching` and scroll down to `Geocache Lists`.  A list of my downloadable pocket queries (PQs) appears and I select the one I'd like to load, for example, "Local - Not Found" with a count of 500 and status of "Not Synced".  Download of 500 caches took less than 2 minutes, not bad, but I got NOTHING.  Trying that again...  status message says "Basic geocache details downloaded.  Descriptions, Hints and Logs will now be downloaded in the background."

I go to `Menu` then `Geocaching` (not `Setup`) and still... NOTHING.

So, what worked somewhat last evening, isn't working anymore.  Rather frustrating.
