Maybe not as bad as predicted (at least per some predictions) but it was enough wet snow for me.  Took almost an hour to clear using my EGO cordless snow-thrower (love it) and there's more to be done before Mackenzie and I can leave for work in the morning.  

Fortunately both Grinnell College and South Tama County schools were closed today.  GC re-opens at noon tomorrow and STC just announced that they will be closed on Wednesday too.  

The captioned photo above is where I left it this evening at about 5:30 PM.  The photo below shows the first 1-minute of my progress at about 4:30 PM.  I posted a track-log of the "walk" at [https://hikes.summittdweller.com/hikes/2024/01/2024-01-09_0430pm/](http://localhost:1313/hikes/2024/01/2024-01-09_0430pm/).

Ultimately I burned through 4 large EGO batteries.  Clearing the drive in the past would typically take only 2 with some capacity to spare.  

I still have more to do before going to work tomorrow.  Got another storm heading this way on Wednesday evening so I better get at it in the morning.  Wish me luck.

## Update: 10-01-2024 @ 10 AM

Managed to get the snow-thrower out again to finish up last evening's work before heading back to Grinnell in a bit.   34 minutes of effort covering about 3/4 of a mile.  I'll post another track log at https://hikes.summittdweller.com soon.  I did take one more photo to give some perspective to the front porch situation.  

I really should have taken a photo before I started.  The snow shelf extending down off the roof was easily 2' deep/tall x 8' long x 16" thick...before I knocked it down, an effort that took 12 pokes with my shovel.   Went through another two EGO batteries in the effort.
