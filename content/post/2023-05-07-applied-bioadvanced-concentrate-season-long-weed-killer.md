Today I applied one bottle (29 oz.) of  BioAdvancedâ„¢ Concentrate Season Long Weed Killer to my entire lawn in 9 applications using my Ryobi 1-gallon chemical sprayer.  Mix was 3.5oz per tank with each application covering about 500 square feet.

We shall see how it performs.  See [https://bioadvanced.com/season-long-weed-control-for-lawns.html](https://bioadvanced.com/season-long-weed-control-for-lawns.html) for more details.
