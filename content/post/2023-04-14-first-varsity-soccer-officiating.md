My knees and back are definitely feeling better than 2 weeks ago.  Tonight I was AR2 for a varsity women's match with Independence at STC.  Final score was 11-2 on a very windy night, and it showed.  The crew of TJ and Dustin did a great job and I feel like I learned a lot from them tonight.  Thank you, gentlemen.
