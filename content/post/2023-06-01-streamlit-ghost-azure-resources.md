I've got Mackenzie looking at Streamlit as a means of building a mobile-friendly app that I can use to create posts like this one.  That app will need to allow me to edit  a TITLE and Markdown BODY fields, capture location and time, and post all of that information to my personal blog... preferably from my cell phone.  I've captured some possible resources and guidance in [https://www.one-tab.com/page/71iaDADxT-eLEOx15qeVnQ](https://www.one-tab.com/page/71iaDADxT-eLEOx15qeVnQ).
