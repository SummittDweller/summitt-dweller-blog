This afternoon I'm adding `https://digital.grinnell.edu` (site ID is 17) to my own Matomo instance and I'm prompted to upgrade PHP on that Matomo droplet (DigitalOcean).  I did so quite easily following [Upgrade PHP from 7.2 to 7.4 on CentOS 8 and Apache](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/upgrade-php-from-7-2-to-7-4-on-centos-8-and-apache).  I've also updated my Drupal version, and some modules, in [https://digital.grinnell.edu](https://digital.grinnell.edu) along with adding the `matomo` module, but that module is now reporting:

    
        The validation of "http://analytics.summittservices.com/matomo.php" failed with error "Error opening socket ssl://analytics.summittservices.com:443" (HTTP code 0).
        The validation of "https://analytics.summittservices.com/matomo.php" failed with error "Error opening socket ssl://analytics.summittservices.com:443" (HTTP code 0).
    

Hmmm...wonder what's up with that?

So, I tried this...
