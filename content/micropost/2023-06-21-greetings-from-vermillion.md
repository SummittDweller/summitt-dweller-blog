Arrived in Vermillion, South Dakota, last evening about 6:30 PM and went straight to dinner at the "Old Lumber Company" downtown.  Checked in to our hotel adjacent to the Univ. of South Dakota campus at about 7:15 PM and went to find the music department building (the fine arts center) where Christine will be taking classes for the rest of the week.

While she's in class I'll be working from my hotel room here, or maybe from the USD library.
